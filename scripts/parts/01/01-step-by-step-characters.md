# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
## Overview

Your first step in playing an operative in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character
is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or asari)
and a class (such as sentinel or vanguard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the universe.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of operative you want to play. You might be a courageous soldier,
a skulking infiltrator, a fervent sentinel, or a flamboyant adept. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny engineer who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. The
conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with
a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this section, the term __character sheet__ means whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a
[formal character sheet](/assets), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.

## 1. Choose a Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character races are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. Some races also have subraces, such as
pure-blood asari or tank-bred krogan. The [Races](/phb/races) section provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

<h3>Galaxy Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
The available races to play are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. The distinctions are based on
Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most races had an
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Ark#Arks" target="_blank">Ark</a> for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy.
And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Batarian_Scrapper" target="_blank">were recruited</a>
as security assets on Ark Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that
we've deemed inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master.
See the <nuxt-link to="/phb/intro#universe-to-explore">A Universe to Explore</nuxt-link> section for more information about the two Galaxies.

<h3 class="mt-3">Class Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. Instead of making our own distinctions
about what races can play what classes, we used the race/class combinations available in the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_Multiplayer/Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect 3</a>
and <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda_Multiplayer#Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>
multiplayer systems.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. Therefore, you are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Masters about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the decision
concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Biotics" target="_blank">Mass Effect Wiki's page about biotics</a> has
a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled "Alien Biotics" and "Biotics in Andromeda."
If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.

## 2. Choose a Class

Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she
possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging
in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the [Classes](/phb/classes) section.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities
(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of
proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things
your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level

### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). A
1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate
and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the
game, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the
assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your
class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level
character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).

### Hit Points and Hit Die
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points
are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal
to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which
you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the
number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions#resting">Resting</nuxt-link> in the Missions section).

### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>, tools
in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#tools-kits">Equipment</nuxt-link>.) Your background gives you additional skill and
tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of
these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency
bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 2</strong><br>
Sam imagines Keleem firing tech spells from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’
proficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.

As a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.
Sam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also
notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.
</v-alert>

<source-reference pages="6-7" source="basic"></source-reference>


## 3. Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: __Strength__, __Dexterity__, __Constitution__,
__Intelligence__, __Wisdom__, and __Charisma__. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>
section. The Ability Score Summary provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races
increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.

<ai-dialog title="Ability Score summary" component="ability-score-summary"></ai-dialog>

You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest
three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time
or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores
as a result of your race choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.
To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result
by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.


<ai-dialog title="Ability Scores and Modifiers" component="ability-score-modifiers"></ai-dialog>

<v-alert type="info" :value="true">
<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 3</strong><br>
Sam decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Kaleem’s abilities. Since she’s an engineer,
she puts her highest score, 15, in Intelligence. Her next-highest, 14, goes in Dexterity. Kaleem might be a charismatic,
good leader, but Sam decides she wants the salarian to be tougher and stronger than most of her kind, so she puts decent
scores in Strength and Constitution. After applying her racial benefits (increasing Kaleems’s Intelligence by 2 and her
Dexterity by 1), Kaleem’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 15 (+2),
Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 17 (+3), Wisdom 10 (0), Charisma 8 (-1).

Sam fills in Kaleem’s final hit points: 8 + her Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.
</v-alert>

### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
At your Galaxy Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here
allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost
table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,
before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15,
15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers
between those extremes.

## 4. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character’s
name, physical description, and personality might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you.
It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. Or you can randomize you 
characters height and weight.

<ai-dialog title="Random Height & Weight Table" component="random-height-weight" />

<br>

### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

<v-alert type="info" :value="true">
<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4</strong><br>
Sam lets her ability scores influence the type of character Kaleem is: her high Intelligence suggests a rapid, focused
mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or
awkward social decorum.

## 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring
gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section.


__Starting Credits__ <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You
have a number of credits to spend based on your _race_ (not your class as in D&D 5th). The range of average starting credits
is roughly equivalent across races, but the variability changes based on race. Long-lived races (asari and krogan) have lower
variability, whereas short-lived races (salarians and vorcha) have a high variability.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry and armor you can wear. Try not to purchase equipment with
a total weight exceeding your Strength score times 2. <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#strength">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>
has more information on carrying capacity.

### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in combat. Things that contribute to your
AC include the armor you wear and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor, however.

Without armor, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor,
calculate your AC using the rules in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#armor">Armor</nuxt-link> section. Record
your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor to wear and use it effectively, and your armor proficiencies are
determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
the Equipment section.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give
you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

### Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage
you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient
with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

For attacks with __melee weapons__, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_finesse_ property, such as a monomolecular blade, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

For attacks with __ranged weapons__, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_recoil_ property, such as the M-300 Claymore, can use your Strength modifier instead.

<v-alert type="info" :value="true">
<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 5</strong><br>
Sam writes down the starting equipment from the engineer class and the scrapper background. Her starting equipment
includes Stock Medium Armor which (after adding her Dexterity modifier) gives Kaleem an Armor Class of 16.

For Kaleem’s weapons, Sam chooses an M-8 Avenger (because she took the Assault Rifle proficiency) and an Omni-torch.
Her M-8 Avenger is a ranged weapon, so Kaleem uses her Dexterity modifier for her attacks and damage. Her attack bonus is
her Dexterity modifier (+2) plus her proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +4. The M-8 Avenger deals 1d8 piercing damage,
and Kaleem adds her Dexterity modifier to the damage when she hits, for a total of 1d8 + 2 piercing damage. Notice, 
she does not add her proficiency bonus to the damage roll, only the attack roll. When using the
Omni-torch, a melee weapon, Kaleem adds her Strength modifier (+1) to the attack roll and the damage roll. But, because 
she is not proficient with melee weapons, she does not add her proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
</v-alert>

<source-reference pages="9" source="basic"></source-reference>


## Coming Together

Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a __party__, a group of operatives working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the galaxy.
Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts
of assignments the group might undertake.

<source-reference pages="9" source="basic"></source-reference>

## Overview

As your character goes on missions and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience
points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called
__gaining a level__.

### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description.
Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases
at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll,
and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his
Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8 (1 additional hit point for each level).

### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20 and the
proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see
what other improvements you gain at each level.
