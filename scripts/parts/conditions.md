#### Blinded

* A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.





#### Charmed

* A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
* The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.





#### Deafened

* A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.





#### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a
creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

Level | Effect
--- | ---
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks
2 | Speed halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 | Hit point maximum halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | Death

<br>

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.





#### Frightened

* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
* The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.





#### Frozen

* A frozen creature is *incapacitated* and can't move or speak.
* The creature is *primed" sub="cold*. Any detonating attack ends the lifted condition after resolving
the detonation effect.
* The creature automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.





#### Grappled

* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is *incapacitated*.
* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect,
such as when a creature is hurled away by the throw spell.





#### Incapacitated

* An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.





#### Indoctrinated

_Inspired by Stephen W._

If your campaign is set during any part of the Reaper invasion, it's likely you'll need some 
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Indoctrination" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> effects.
While we encourage you to riff on these ideas or make up your own, here is a baseline for using indoctrination in your
campaign.

Spending time in the presence of a creature or object that can cause indoctrination (namely, Reaper technology) can 
lead to a special condition called indoctrination. Indoctrination is measured in six levels. For each 24 hour 
period a creature spends within the presence of an indoctrinating source, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of indoctrination. If an already indoctrinated creature spends another 
24 hour period within the presence of Reaper technology, the DC of the saving throw increases as described below.

Level | Next Wisdom DC | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | 12 | You have difficulty sleeping and constantly have dreams of inky black and oily shadows. To gain the benefits of a long rest takes an additional 4 hours.
2 | 14 | You begin showings signs of paranoia, having feelings of being watched. You have disadvantage on all your Charisma-based skill checks.
3 | 16 | You have extreme paranoia. You have disadvantage on all of your Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.
4 | 18 | You begin to hear voices that issue simple commands. If you do not immediately follow the command, you take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. This damage bypasses shields.
5 | 20 | The voices in your head speak to you often and you begin to agree with what they're saying. You are considered charmed.
6 | - | You become a Reaper thrall and lose all control of your character (You are effectively dead).

### Reducing Indoctrination Levels
Every long rest that a creature spends outside of the range of an indoctrinating source, it can make a new 
Wisdom saving throw (DC based on its current indoctrination level). On a success, reduce its indoctrination level by 1.

Note: Synthetic creatures are immune to indoctrination.

### Reaper Tech

Usually, indoctrination happens when another creature (such as a reaper, thorian, or leviathan) is actively trying to 
indoctrinate one or many creatures. An exception to this is Reaper technology (i.e., reaper parts or devices salvaged from 
battle or space). Reaper technology can passively indoctrinate creatures that are merely in the technology's presence. 
Determining if a creature is within the presence of a piece of Reaper technology is based on the technology's size. 
The larger the object, the farther the range.

#### Distance of Indoctrination
Size of tech | Range
--- | ---
Tiny | 10 meters
Small | 25 meters
Medium | 100 meters
Large | 1 kilometer (~ 1/2 a mile)
Huge | 10 kilometers (~ 6 miles)
Gargantuan |  100 kilometers (~ 60 miles)





#### Invisible

* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of gadgets or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding,
the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.





#### Lifted

* A lifted creature is *restrained*.
* The creature is *primed" sub="force*. Any detonating attack ends the lifted condition after resolving the
detonation effect.
* Any lifted object has no mass and is dangled in the air by a temporary mass effect field. Thus, a lifted creature can be
pushed, pulled, or otherwise manipulated for varying results.





#### Paralyzed

* A paralyzed creature is *incapacitated* and can't move or speak.
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 2 meters of the creature.





#### Poisoned

* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.





#### Primed

* When a primed creature is hit with a spell or ability that __detonates__, the primed condition explodes, resulting
in one of the following effect. After resolving the effect, the primed condition ends.


Primed Type | Explosion
--- | ---
Force | The primed target takes 2d6 force damage, is knocked back 6m and becomes prone.
Necrotic | The primed target takes 1d12 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.
Fire | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, catch fire, taking 1d6 fire damage. Each creature continues to burn for 1 minute, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that is on fire can use its action put out the fire.
Cold | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, must pass a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save a creature is frozen until the end of its next turn.
Lightning | Each creature within a 4m radius, including the primed target, takes 3d4 lightning damage.





#### Prone

* A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

#### Targeting

* A targeting creature's speed is reduced by half and it cannot take actions and or reactions, except to end this condition.
* The creature automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Targeting ends if one of the following occurs:
  * The creature uses a bonus action or reaction to end the condition. The reaction is taken which the creature sees another creature make an attack or cast a spell.
  * When the creature gains full or three-quarter cover
  * When the creature is knocked prone, lifted, or incapacitated.





#### Unconscious
