# Introduction
## Introduction
The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e
takes that storytelling to the stars. Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,
D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how an
N7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.

<simple-card><template slot="text">
__Galaxy Master (GM)__: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile
lock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite
side of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defense system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears
to be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals
on your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge
of the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in …
\
__Amanda (playing Melphine)__: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.
\
__Amie (playing Telos)__: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.
Do I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?
</template></simple-card>

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’
action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,
roll away from the strike of a biotic attack, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,
but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

<simple-card><template slot="text">
__Galaxy Master (GM)__: OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?
\
__Amanda__: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?
\
__GM__: Make a Wisdom check.
\
__Amanda__: Does my Perception skill apply?
\
__GM__: Of course!
\
__Amanda (rolling a d20)__: Rats. I rolled a six, plus two for my perception skill modifier. So, Eight.
\
__GM__: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?
</template></simple-card>

In the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other
operatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,
the glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.
The operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies
and relics from a past age.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates
missions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the
entrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?
Propel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, "affixing" themselves to the surface of 
the asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM
can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each
mission can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a
__campaign__. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends
every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each
monster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also
earns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.
Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an
operative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,
the other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the
player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,
but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## A Universe to Explore

Mass Effect spans two galaxies: the Milky Way and Andromeda. Both have biotics, advanced tech, brave soldiers and fantastic
missions. But the galaxies are vastly different. The Milky Way has been settled by sentient beings for millennia and most of
its clusters, star systems, and planets have been charted and explored. It's also home to a variety of sentient alien species,
all with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar
with the first Mass Effect video games, you can read about major events and lore at the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki" target="_blank">Mass Effect Wiki</a>. Specifically, the
<A href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline" target="_blank">timeline</a> can get you quickly up to speed to on the events
of the galaxy.

The Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of "Remnant" seem to exist on every planet, connected
by seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient races existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way
races. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way
races arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like
to read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda, <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda#Setting" target="_blank">
the wiki</a> has plenty of information.

Both galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but
each galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.
You could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign
on the timeline, you might also deal with the impending invasion of <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper" target="_blank">the Reapers</a>.
In contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of
setting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way
is an urban setting with a defined lore and timeline. Andromeda is rural and more of a sandbox for campaigns.

Your GM might set the campaign in one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so
much diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house
rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,
even if the setting is a published world.

<v-alert :value="true" type="info">
It is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies. The passengers of Andromeda's arks
spent 600 years in cryo-sleep. But you could certainly spend part of your campaign in the Milky Way and take a 600-year nap!

## Using these Rules

This manual uses the <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Basic Rules</a>
as its core rule set. If you have never played D&D 5e, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basic rules
first. Most of those rules are replicated and referenced in the rules section of this Player's Manual.

Not repeated here are basic rules for Dungeon (Galaxy) Masters which have additional rules on running successful campaigns.

### Using the Site

The __Rules__ dropdown on the left contains the necessary information you need for creating characters, going on missions,
leveling up, casting spells, and acquiring all the different types of equipment and vehicles available to you. Sections
that contain significant changes are:
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment">Equipment</nuxt-link>, which includes brand-new rules for armor, weapons, and mods
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link>, which includes information on kinetic barriers (shields)
- <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/vehicles">Vehicles</nuxt-link>, which contains a "bolt-on" set of rules for traveling through the galaxy

<br>

The __Characters__ dropdown contains the list of options you have when creating your characters which has brand new:
-  <nuxt-link to="/phb/races">Races</nuxt-link>
-  <nuxt-link to="/phb/classes">Classes</nuxt-link>
-  <nuxt-link to="/phb/backgrounds">Backgrounds</nuxt-link>

<br>

The __Equipment__ section has links to all of the equipment lists, weapons, mods, armor, and other unique items.

__Spells & Powers__ contains the list of all the new Spells in this homebrew.

__Bestiary__ has entirely new monsters and aliens to fight.

The __Appendix__ has information on Skills (including new and removed), Conditions, and Weapon Properties.

__GM Tools__ contains a number of interesting tools to assist Galaxy Masters in running the game.

<v-alert :value="true" type="info">

__VARIANT RULES__

Occasionally, you'll see a rule preceded by the word "Variant". This means the rule is optional. In some cases,
it may replace an existing rule. For example, the Variant: Encumbrance rule replaces the standard Lifting & Carrying rules.

In other instances, the rule may be completely ignored. For example, the Paragon & Renegade system adds rules for utilizing
paragon and renegade points. While this adds a nice touch of flavor from the original _Mass Effect_ trilogy, it is not required
for this system to work, and it can safely be left out of your campaign if desired.

## How to Play

The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.

### 1. The GM describes the environment.
The GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, detailing the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).

### 2. The players describe what they want to do.
Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different
operatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol
spray-painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens
to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say
that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some
other circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what
happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

### 3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.

Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds, whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or
locked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is
more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.

Often the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal
descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many
players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the
game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a
scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

### Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many
bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different
ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are
numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.
In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.
For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the
number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on
whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

### The D20

Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari
believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation
grenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters
might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are
the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of
the game. All three follow these simple steps.

#### 1. Roll the die and add a modifier.
Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/character-creation">Step-By-Step Characters</nuxt-link> for details on each ability and how to determine an
ability’s modifier.)

#### 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.
A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

#### 3. Compare the total to a target number.
If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,
it’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a __Difficulty Class (DC)__. The target number for an
attack roll is called an __Armor Class (AC)__.

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>
provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.
Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you
have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if
you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17
and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in the
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores#advantage-and-disadvantage">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> section.

### Specific Beats General
This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,
gadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how
the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every
soldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking
are more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.
Biotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you
end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

## Missions

The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each
character brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,
racial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best
party of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.
The operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.

The mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras
in a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.

Over the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations
that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture
each other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And
often, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the
current situation. All along, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what
they’ll try to do next.

Aissions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no
more than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other
challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end
of a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of
their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of
multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group
of operatives following the narrative from start to finish.

### The Three Pillars of a mission

__Exploration__ includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations
that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters
to do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the
characters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On
the smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.

__Social interaction__ features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a
captured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemy's stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for
mercy from a krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.

The rules in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> and
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions">Missions</nuxt-link> support exploration
and social interaction.

__Combat__, the focus of the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link> section, involves characters and other creatures
shooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a
game session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a
pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for operatives to attempt wacky stunts like surfing on a drone,
to examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
