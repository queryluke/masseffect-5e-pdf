## Volus


The volus are an associate race on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client race of the turians. They 
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry. 

### Mysterious Biology
The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, 
and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen 
air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually 
split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, 
especially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly 
sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider 
the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant. 

### Trade Warriors
The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,
volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has 
made volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. 
Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the 
Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were
responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the "credit" as the standard currency of interstellar
trade.

Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending
their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,
sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never
spent a cred.

### Council Seat
Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the 
Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need 
to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the 
Krogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, 
none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction
of well-armed dreadnoughts. 

### Volus Names
Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family 
name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring.

### Volus Traits

__Available Classes__. Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

__Age__. Most volus reach adulthood around their 50th year and live to be around 200 years-old.

__Alignment__. Volus society tends towards lawful as a whole, with clans fighting over economic resources and aggressive negotiating, even if they are individually chaotic individuals. They tend towards neutral morality.

__Size__. Volus are between 1 and 1.5 metes (3-4'). Your size is Small.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 8m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Fury of the Small__. When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the
attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


__Hermetic Suit__. Your suit is your lifeblood and consists of a reinforced, pressurized body suit and helmet. It makes your immune to 
disease and provides resistance to poison and necrotic damage. 

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your 
suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.

If you are not in an environment made for volus, for each minute in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer 
2d6 poison and 1d6 slashing damage. If you do not repair your suit or get to a volus-appropriate environment within 10 minutes, you die.


__Lucky__. You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one 
luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, 
but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then 
choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to 
influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.


__Savvy Dealings__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.
