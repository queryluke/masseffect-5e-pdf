<h3>Galaxy Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
The available races to play are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. The distinctions are based on
Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most races had an
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Ark#Arks" target="_blank">Ark</a> for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy.
And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Batarian_Scrapper" target="_blank">were recruited</a>
as security assets on Ark Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that
we've deemed inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master.
See the <nuxt-link to="/phb/intro#universe-to-explore">A Universe to Explore</nuxt-link> section for more information about the two Galaxies.

<h3 class="mt-3">Class Restrictions <v-chip color="secondary" text-color="white" class="v-chip--x-small">new</v-chip></h3>
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. Instead of making our own distinctions
about what races can play what classes, we used the race/class combinations available in the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_Multiplayer/Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect 3</a>
and <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda_Multiplayer#Character_Customization" target="_blank">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>
multiplayer systems.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. Therefore, you are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Masters about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the decision
concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, the
<a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Biotics" target="_blank">Mass Effect Wiki's page about biotics</a> has
a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled "Alien Biotics" and "Biotics in Andromeda."
If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.
