## 4.c Background

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an operative, and
your place in the galaxy. Your soldier might have been a mercenary or a former Specter. Your adept could have been a
government experiment or a celebrated artisan. Your infiltrator might be a political assassin or gathered intel for the
Shadow Broker.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question
to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?
Where did you get the credits to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

A background also gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might
also give you additional proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality
information you develop, on your character sheet.

### Suggested Characteristics
A colonist is generally not far traveled and has lived most their life on a single planet. However, colonies can vary in size,

of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any
respect for law or authority.

or gain access to normally off-limits locations by leveraging your position as a doctor if your services are needed.

<div class="hr"></div>

### Suggested Characteristics
Doctors are defined by their ability to give medical treatment to the pained and wounded. All doctors are united by their
desire to "fix what is broken", although some view this ability as a means to an end instead of a gift in and of itself.

the Citadel. You receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending

something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a city district or colony where you have performed, they typically
take a liking to you.

__Specialty__. A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines. Choose
one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.

1d8 | Routines

without it suspecting something (other than what you offer).

__Alternate Feature: Unrequited Love__. At some point in your service, a patron became obsessed with you, expressing his undying
love and vowing to protect you at all costs. Whenever you are in need, you can request this patron's aid. As long as you feign
reciprocal feelings they will fulfill your request to the best of their abilities, even to the point of sacrificing their life for you.

<div class="hr"></div>

### Suggested Characteristics
When creating an Escort, think about how they feel about their situation. Do they enjoy their work? Do they hate it?
Is there a reason they're doing it? This can be useful in deciding how your Courtesan will act.

### Choose one of the following features

__Feature: What Doesn't Kill You__. You were the subject of experimentation in your youth, with the goal of stripping
away the old you and turning you into a weapon. The program could have been funded by your race's government, a
shadow organization, or a single mad scientist who kidnapped you. It could have had the goal of turning you into the
ultimate soldier, perhaps an unrivaled biotic, or even a genius tech engineer.

Regardless of the program's nature or success, you survived your difficult trials and came out tougher for it. You've
been pushed to the edge of death before, so it doesn't scare you. Once per long rest, you can choose to make a death
saving throw with advantage due to your strong drive to survive.

<div class="hr"></div>

### Suggested Characteristics
Experiments are all maladjusted to society, but not all experiments are unable to adapt. Most experiments prefer to be loners
and come off as aloof or emotionless. Over time, with a close-knit group, some experiments tend to open up and show a softer side.

provide assistance. You know a set of secret signs, encrypted communication channels, and passwords you can use to identify
such agents, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

__Faction__. As a faction agent, you're part of a larger faction, which could be criminal, military, religious, political, etc.
You can work with your GM to create a faction or you can use an existing one from the Mass Effect Universe. Some faction
examples are the Shadow Broker Network, Blue Suns, Special Tasks Group, Cerberus, Eclipse, and the Blood Pack. Agents
are more than hired mercenaries and are supportive of their faction's efforts.

<div class="hr"></div>

### Suggested Characteristics
Faction Agents are shaped by their experience in the line of duty. The beliefs, laws, and practices of their faction can
affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy that counteracts the tenets of their faction.
For example, a Shadow Broker Agent that secretly wants transparency of information. Or they might have an ideal or bond
that is taken to an extreme, such as a Cerberus agent that hates all non-human races and kills them whenever possible.
