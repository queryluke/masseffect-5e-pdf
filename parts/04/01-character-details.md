# Chapter 4: Personality and Background
Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.### 4.a Appearance

### Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even
if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your
character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. For example, asari only have a single "gender", which
is generally seen by other races as female (they also utilize female pronouns). But an asari considers herself as androgynous
or hermaphroditic. You could also play a male character who presents himself as a female, a woman who feels trapped in
a male body, or a tough looking female krogan who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s
sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description. Think about
what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin.
A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

### Other Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.A</strong><br>
Sam fills in some of Kaleem’s basic details: her name, her sex (female), her height and weight, and the fact that she
is missing a cranial ridge (making her unattractive being by salarian standards).

### 4.b Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment
is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes
toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently
faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

__Lawful good (LG)__ creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Asari justicars, quarians,
and some turians are lawful good.

__Neutral good (NG)__ beings do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many salarians and most
protheans are neutral good.

__Chaotic good (CG)__ creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.
Some angara, asari, and a number of humans are chaotic good.

__Lawful neutral (LN)__ individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Some geth, volus, and
most drell are lawful neutral.

__Neutral (N)__ is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what
seems best at the time. Volus, some batarians, and many humans are neutral.

__Chaotic neutral (CN)__ creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.
Maiden asari, some vorcha, and humans are chaotic neutral.

__Lawful evil (LE)__ creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or
order. Most Krogan, volus, and batarians are lawful evil.

__Neutral evil (NE)__ is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.
Heretic geth, Reapers, and vorcha are neutral evil.

__Chaotic evil (CE)__ creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
Some Krogan, batarians, and some Vorcha are chaotic evil.

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.B</strong><br>
Sam picks a lawful alignment for Kaleem, as she buys into the tradition of the Blue Suns and respects their codes. Kaleem's
lack of empathy makes her neutral in her disposition for moral codes.

### 4.d Personality

Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person
a unique identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are
presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s
favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your
imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.

### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart
from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.
They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.
“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells
you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character
dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define
one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,
or be cocky about your high score.

### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental
moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to
make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background
includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.
The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.
They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against
your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations
and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?
What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or
personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.

### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness —
in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.
More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you?
What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

<strong>BUILDING KALEEM, STEP 4.D</strong><br>
Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her friends.
She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the universe
is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.

### 4.e Languages

Languages are not a part of Mass Effect 5e. Our interpretation is that there is enough technology to translate languages
on the fly, making it seem that everyone is speaking the same common tongue. Even new discovered races can have their
languages mapped into a universal translator in a number of hours utilizing underlying linguistic morphisms and lexical
cues fed into a supercomputer. However, how you and your GM choose to handle ancient or alien languages is up to your party.
Your asari archaeologist might be an expert in ancient alien glyphs or you might lay a Krogan who is known for reciting
poetry in an old dialect. This type of flavor is encouraged, but this system does not codify any specific languages.
