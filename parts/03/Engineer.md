#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-8 Avenger
- Omni-Taser, Omni-Blade,  or Omni-Torch
- Stock Light Armor or Stock Medium Armor

### Spellcasting


#### Preparing and casting spells
The Engineer table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
engineer spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Engineer table.

For example, a 9th-level engineer can cast spells for 1, 2, or 3 tech points.

You prepare the list of engineer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the engineer spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of engineer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.

For example, if you are a 4th-level engineer with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

<br>

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of engineer spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Engineers use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an engineer, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier


### Drone

As an Action, spend 1 tech point to summon one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, disruption, recon, or rocket.
The stat blocks for the drones can be found in the [bestiary](/phb/bestiary).

When summoned, the drone has additional hit points equal to twice your engineer level. Whenever the drone makes a saving
throw, damage or healing roll, add your proficiency bonus to the roll. Whenever the drone attacks, apply your proficiency bonus 
instead of the drone's to the roll.

You have complete control over the drone. Any hacking attempts on the drone are rolled against your intelligence, not the drone's. 
The drone has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.

The drone lasts 1 minute or until its hit points become 0 or lower.


### Engineer's Efficiency

Starting at 3rd level, you're able to optimize a basic tech spell. Choose one of the following
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You always have this spell prepared. You may cast a 1 tech point version
of this spell without expending any tech points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

You can prepare the advanced version of the selected spell at the cost of 1 prepared spell.

You can cast a more potent version of this spell at higher levels. A 2 tech point version at 7th,
3 tech point version at 11th, and 4 tech point version at 15th.

With 8 hours of programming your omni-tool, you can exchange the selected spell with either Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload.
 


### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

You may instead take a Feat.


### Recharge (1d4)

Beginning at 7th level, you've created a small reserve battery for your omni-tool, allowing you to regain some spent
tech points. Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute cycling the power of your omni-tool gaining tech points equal to 
1d4 + your intelligence modifier. Your total tech points cannot exceed the tech points column for your engineer level
(as indicated on the engineer progression table). 


### Ability Score Improvement

At 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Invention

At 20th level, you create an invention. The invention should be condoned by the DM to not be overpowered. But 
should give you, your party, your drones, etc an advantage.


## Subclasses

### Mastermind

Masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals, using strategy and perfectly timed attacks to win in battle.

#### Enfilade

Starting at 2nd level, if an ally uses a power that primes an enemy within 10m, you may use your reaction to detonate the primed enemy with a
quick tech burst that cannot miss.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any
expended uses when you finish a long rest.


#### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make
that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Disrupting Attack

At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your tech spells.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against
a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.


#### Tactical Advantage

Starting at 14th level, when you prepare an advanced version of a spell you prepare both advancements. When you
cast an advanced spell you can choose to cast either advancement option.


#### Spell Steal

At 18th level, you gain the ability to clone spell effects onto your omni-tool.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell
save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect on you and you copy a temporary version of the spell onto
your omni-tool if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it does not have to be a tech spell). For the
next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your tech points. The creature can't cast that spell until the
8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


### Drone Jockey

A drone jockey forms a bond with their mechanical companion, giving it a body, name and increasing its potency on the battlefield.

#### Drone Companion


At 2nd level, you've learned to construct a drone companion. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 5000 credits worth of materials, 
you augment one of your drone's VI into a rudimentary AI, then create a synthetic body, transferring the AI into the body. 
Choose one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, recon, rocket.

If your drone companion is ever slain, 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 2500 credits worth of materials, can create 
a new body and replicate the AI from a backup.

You can still summon a temporary drone using your tech points.


#### Drone's Bond

Your drone companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

* The drone companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
* The drone companion loses its vulnerability to lightning damage.
* The drone companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you
  determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its
  own. It has advantage on saving throws against any ability that tries to influence its actions.
* Your drone companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your
  proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a drone
  companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
* Your drone companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
* For each level you gain after the 2nd, your drone companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points 1d8 (or 5) + its constitution modifier.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion
  can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
  normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies
  otherwise.
* Your companion shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the
  tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The Engineer who created me is a beloved
  companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”

action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make an attack.


#### Drone's Defense

At 10th level, your companion gains 10 shield points and 5 regen. Additionally, while your companion can see you,
it has advantage on all saving throws.

### Medic

The name says it all. As a medic, you'll be one on the field that can dress a wound and get your comrades back into fighting shape.

#### Repair Drone

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine. If you are already proficient in Medicine, you may choose 
another skill to become proficient in.

Add the Repair drone to the list of drones available for you to summon.


#### Medi-gel Enhancements

At 6th level, you can spend 6 hours in a lab, or similar environment, using drugs to enhance the capabilities of standard medi-gel. It 
takes 2 hours to craft a single enhancement, but you can apply that benefit to any number of medi-gel cartridges. To craft 
another enhancement takes an additional 6 hours. Instead of using time to limit this feature, your GM can choose to allow 
you to add X divided by 2 (rounded up) enhancements, where X is your Intelligence modifier; then, you must finish a long 
rest before you can create new enhancements. Only one enhancement can be added to a medi-gel cartridge.

When creating an enhancement, choose from the list below:

Name | Enhancement
--- | ---
Stimulant | After using this medi-gel, you have advantage on the next saving throw or attack roll you make within 1 minute.
Opioid | Within 1 minute of using this medi-gel, if you would fall below 0 hit point but not outright die, you may fall to 1 hit point instead.
Steroid | After using this medi-gel, add +2 damage to all melee damage for 1 minute.
Minagen X3 | After using this medi-gel, gain +2 damage to all biotic spells and cantrips for 1 minute.

#### Shield Boost

At 10th level, you can use your action to restore some of your party's shields. 
Choose up to 5 friendly creatures with shields you can see. Hack into their armor system and use a brute 
force algorithm to overload their kinetic barrier. Roll 4d8. Each creature immediately gains that many shield points, 
even if their total shield point capacity is less than the amount rolled.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.


#### Repair Drone

At 14th level, when you summon a Repair drone, you summon an improved version of it. It gains twice its hit points 
and shields, +2 AC, and can cast the First Aid ability 5 times per day and casts a 2 tech point version of it.


#### Supply Pylon

By 18th level, you can call in a 2m tall by 1m wide supply pylon to a location within 4m. At the start of your next turn, the pylon arrives. If any creature is 
standing in the targeted location, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage. 
On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

The pylon contains 5 resources from the following list, which you choose when you call the pylon:

* 1 heavy weapon ammo charges
* 10 thermal clips
* A battery capable to quickly recharging your Omni-tool, recovering 5 tech points
* A stim pack capable of staving off biotic fatigue, recovering 5 levels worth of spell slots 
* 4 enhanced medi-gel
* 2 Mk II Frag grenades
* 2 Mk II Lift Grenades
* 2 Mk IV Flashbang
* 2 Mk IV Smoke grenades

Once the pylon has landed, friendly creatures (including you) within melee range of the pylon can use their action to collect
one of the resources you chose.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest and restock the pylon with 5 omni-gel.
