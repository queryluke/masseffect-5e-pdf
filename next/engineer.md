## Engineer
He can hear the clicking of their tarsi echoing off the cave walls. Switching his HUD to infrared, he watches the swarm of rachni approach. A few thoughts and his omni-tool begins to spin, sucking in the damp air condensing it into a ball of supercooled liquid. Like throwing a baseball, he flings the liquid toward the horde. Some become brittle and shatter, some slip on the now frozen ground.

In her private workshop below decks on the starship Ravenka, she installs a small thermo-nuclear reactor into her literal and figurative ‘pet’ project. A few presses on her omni-tool and the small drone in front of her blinks a holographic eye into existence and beings to hover in mid-air. A message appears on her omni-tool, “Hello creator, what is on today’s agenda?”

The casings of hundreds of medi-gel canisters are scattered across a lap table, a centrifuge hums quietly in the corner, and a salarian records a constant, near-stream-of-consciousness monologue. Seven seconds before the centrifuge stops, he’s standing in front of it with a modified medi-gel canister, ready to encase his new concoction.

Whether a brilliant scientist, crafty strategist, or gifted tinker, all engineers share a love for technology and a very high IQ. What they lack in martial prowess, they make up for with versatility, preparedness, and an omni-tool that can do the impossible.

### Omni-Tools
Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator. The fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the reuse of salvaged equipment.

Most lifeforms see the omni-tool as a fairly boring device with a few bespoke functions, but engineers see the untapped and unfettered potential. In the hands of an engineer, an omni-tool is the ultimate weapon. Engineers spend countless hours modding and hacking their omni-tool to gain just a little bit more power. Most beings would blow themselves up when attempting these hacks (and quite a few have). But an engineer can thread the line between peak performance and critical failure.

### Drones

The understood threshold of becoming an engineer is configuring your omni-tool to summon a drone. Drones are small, lightly-armed combat robots made out of hard-light and equipped with very small mass effect fields that allow them to levitate. They are also equipped with basic VI programming allowing them to adapt to changing situations on the battlefield and have a small amount of shielding.

Drones tend to be deployed as 'cannon fodder', creating distractions and harassing enemies, allowing engineers to operate safely and plan their next attack. Friendly drones are referred to as 'flocks,' and individual drones as ‘birds’ and enemy drones as 'swarms’ and ‘insects’.

### Creating a Engineer
When you create an engineer, you should focus on your love of technology and knowledge. What drives you to take things apart and learn about them? Were you an intellectual prodigy or did you study endlessly? Did you have a teacher or were you self-taught?

You should also think about your engineering background. Do you enjoy mechanical engineers and working with your hands to build new things? Is hacking and coding part of your identity? Or do you feel more like a mad scientist, willing to experiment endlessly on all manner of scientific projects?


#### Quick build
You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Scholar background.

## Class Features

As a engineer, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d8 per engineer level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 8 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor, medium armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose one from Assault Rifles, Melee, or SMGs
- __Tools__: Choose one from Armorsmith's Workbench, Tailor's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Weaponsmith's Workbench
- __Saving Throws__: Constitution, Intelligence
- __Skills__: Choose three from Athletics, Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, Medicine, Science,  and Vehicle Handling

```
```

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-8 Avenger
- Omni-Taser, Omni-Blade,  or Omni-Torch
- Stock Light Armor or Stock Medium Armor

### Spellcasting

Your omni-tool is the source of your spellcasting capabilities. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Preparing and casting spells
The Engineer table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
engineer spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Engineer table.

For example, a 9th-level engineer can cast spells for 1, 2, or 3 tech points.

You prepare the list of engineer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the engineer spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of engineer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.

For example, if you are a 4th-level engineer with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of engineer spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.


### Spellcasting Ability

Engineers use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an engineer, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page


### Drone

At 1st level, you can summon a drone with your omni-tool. As an Action, spend 1 tech point to summon one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, disruption, recon, or rocket.

When summoned, the drone has additional hit points equal to twice your engineer level. Whenever the drone makes a saving
throw, damage or healing roll, add your proficiency bonus to the roll. Whenever the drone attacks, apply your proficiency bonus 
instead of the drone's to the roll.

You have complete control over the drone. Any hacking attempts on the drone are rolled against your intelligence, not the drone's. 
The drone has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.

The drone lasts 1 minute or until its hit points become 0.

### Engineer's Efficiency

Starting at 3rd level, you're able to optimize a basic tech spell. Choose one of the following
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You always have this spell prepared. You may cast a 1 tech point version
of this spell without expending any tech points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

You can prepare the advanced version of the selected spell at the cost of 1 prepared spell.

At 11th level, you can cast a 2 tech point version of your selected spell without expending 
any tech points.

With 8 hours of programming your omni-tool, you can exchange the selected spell with either Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload.

### Ability Score Improvement


At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.

### Recharge

Beginning at 7th level, you've created a small reserve battery for your omni-tool, allowing you to regain some spent
tech points. Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute cycling the power of your omni-tool gaining tech points equal to 
1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. Your total tech points cannot exceed the tech points column for your engineer level, as indicated on the engineer progression table.

The number of tech points you regenerate increases at higher levels. 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier at 11th level and 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier at 15th level.

### Invention

At 20th level, you create an invention. Work with your GM to decide on what the invention should be. Some ideas include an drone upgrade (weapon, armor, shield, etc), a new spell, an improved omni-tool battery, etc.


## Subclasses

Engineers have three subclasses which revolve around their engineering focus. Highly intelligent, battlefield strategists
use tact and preparedness to win at any cost. Some engineers prefer the tinkering lifestyle and can build a permanent
drone companion. Those that would like to focus on biological engineer should seek out the medic subclass, which can heal and support the party.

### Mastermind

Masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals, using strategy and perfectly timed attacks to win in battle.

#### Enfilade

Starting at 2nd level, if an ally uses a power that primes an enemy within 10m, you may use your reaction to detonate the primed enemy with a quick tech burst that cannot miss.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You regain any
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/2/28/MEA_Engineer_Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20180308083149' 
  style='width:300px' />


#### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make
that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Disrupting Attack

At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your tech spells.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against
a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.


#### Tactical Advantage

Starting at 14th level, when you prepare an advanced version of a spell you prepare both advancements. When you
cast an advanced spell you can choose to cast either advancement option.


#### Spell Steal

At 18th level, you gain the ability to clone spell effects onto your omni-tool.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell
save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect on you and you copy a temporary version of the spell onto
your omni-tool if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it does not have to be a tech spell). For the
next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your tech points. The creature can't cast that spell until the
8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Drone Jockey

A drone jockey forms a bond with their mechanical companion, giving it a body, name and increasing its potency on the battlefield.


#### Drone Companion


At 2nd level, you've learned to construct a drone companion. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 5000 credits worth of materials, 
you augment one of your drone's VI into a rudimentary AI, then create a synthetic body, transferring the AI into the body. 
Choose one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, recon, rocket.

If your drone companion is ever slain, 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 2500 credits worth of materials, can create 
a new body and replicate the AI from a backup.

You can still summon a temporary drone using your tech points.


#### Drone's Bond

Your drone companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

* The drone companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
* The drone companion loses its vulnerability to lightning damage.
* The drone companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you
  determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its
  own. It has advantage on saving throws against any ability that tries to influence its actions.
* Your drone companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your
  proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a drone
  companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
* Your drone companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.

```
```

* For each level you gain after the 2nd, your drone companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points 1d8 (or 5) + its constitution modifier.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion
  can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
  normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies
  otherwise.
* Your companion shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the
  tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The Engineer who created me is a beloved
  companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”

#### Coordinated Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you and your drone companion form a more potent fighting force. When you use the Attack 
action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make an attack.


#### Drone's Defense

At 10th level, your companion gains 10 shield points and 5 regen. Additionally, while your companion can see you,
it has advantage on all saving throws.


#### Assault Protocol

At 14th level, your companion can use its action to make an attack against each creature within 2m of it or each 
creature within 2m of you. It makes a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Drone's Defense

At 18th level, your companion gains another 10 shield points and 5 regen. Additionally, whenever an attacker that your
companion can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack’s damage against it.



### Medic

The name says it all. As a medic, you'll be one on the field that can dress a wound and get your comrades back into fighting shape.

#### Repair Drone

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine. If you are already proficient in Medicine, you may choose 
a different skill.

Add the Repair drone to the list of drones available for you to summon.

#### Medi-gel Enhancements

At 6th level, you can spend 6 hours in a lab, or similar environment, using drugs to enhance the capabilities of standard medi-gel. It 
takes 2 hours to craft a single enhancement, but you can apply that benefit to any number of medi-gel cartridges. To craft 
another enhancement takes an additional 6 hours. Instead of using time to limit this feature, your GM can choose to allow 
you to add X divided by 2 (rounded up) enhancements, where X is your Intelligence modifier; then, you must finish a long 
rest before you can create new enhancements. Only one enhancement can be added to a medi-gel cartridge.

At 10th level, you can use your action to restore some of your party's shields. 
Choose up to 5 friendly creatures with shields you can see. Hack into their armor system and use a brute 
force algorithm to overload their kinetic barrier. Roll 4d8. Each creature immediately gains that many shield points, 
even if their total shield point capacity is less than the amount rolled.

By 18th level, you can call in a 2m tall by 1m wide supply pylon to a location within 4m. At the start of your next turn, the pylon arrives. If any creature is 
standing in the targeted location, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage. 
On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

The pylon contains 5 resources from the following list, which you choose when you call the pylon:

* 1 heavy weapon ammo charges
* 10 thermal clips
* A battery capable to quickly recharging your Omni-tool, recovering 5 tech points
* A stim pack capable of staving off biotic fatigue, recovering 5 levels worth of spell slots 
* 4 enhanced medi-gel
* 2 Mk II Frag grenades
* 2 Mk II Lift Grenades
* 2 Mk IV Flashbang
* 2 Mk IV Smoke grenades

Once the pylon has landed, friendly creatures (including you) within melee range of the pylon can use their action to collect
one of the resources you chose.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest and restock the pylon with 5 omni-gel.
