## Infiltrator

The Infiltrator is a tech-savvy warrior, able to win battles by quickly disabling and killing enemies. These soldiers focus on unlocking alternate routes, gaining access to good equipment, and obtaining an advantageous position over enemies in combat.

## Class Features

As a infiltrator, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d8 per infiltrator level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 8 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per infiltrator level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose two from Assault Rifles, Melee, SMGs, and Sniper Rifles
- __Tools__: Hacking tools or theives' tools
- __Saving Throws__: Dexterity, Intelligence
- __Skills__: Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception, Electronics, History, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Vehicle Handling

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-92 Mantis
- Omni-Taser, Omni-Blade,  or Monomolecular Blade
- Stock Light Armor


### Spellcasting
Your omni-tool is the source of your spellcasting capabilities. You also use a variety of gadgets and devices in the form of combat powers. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Preparing and casting spells
The Infiltrator table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
infiltrator spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Infiltrator table.

For example, a 9th-level infiltrator can cast spells for 1 or 2 tech points.

You prepare the list of infiltrator spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the infiltrator spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of infiltrator spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your infiltrator level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.

For example, if you are a 9th-level infiltrator with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of infiltrator spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Infiltrators use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an Infiltrator, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

</div>

### Tactical Cloak

As an action, you activate your tactical cloak, becoming <condition id="invisible"/>. Tactical cloak lasts 1 minute or
until you make an attack, cast a spell, use a grenade or mine, or fire a heavy weapon.

Once you have used tactical cloak the maximum number of times for your Infiltrator level,
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use tactical 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 6th, 4 at 11th,
and 5 at 18th.

### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either 
of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.



### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can 
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must 
be made with a melee or ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 2m of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, 
and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the 
Infiltrator table.


### Cunning Action

At 2nd level, you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to Dash, Disengage, Hide, or 
activate Tactical Cloak.


### Combat Power

At 2nd level, you know one combat power of your choice from the infiltrator spell list. You learn additional
combat powers of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Infiltrator table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.

  style='width:325px' />

### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.

### Uncanny Dodge

At 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

```
```

### Evasion

At 7th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.


### Reliable Talent

At 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add 
your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible
creature within 4 meters of you.


### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.


### Elusive

At 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while 
you aren't incapacitated.


### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within 
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


## Subclasses
Infiltrators have three subclasses which reflect their preferred combat techniques. Shadow infiltrators prefer to be up close and personal, dealing devastating melee strikes. Snipers are the exact opposite and want to remain as far away from combat as possible. Saboteurs prefer more subtle techniques to turn the tide of battle in their favor.

### Shadow

Shadow Infiltrators are melee specialists that make heavy use of their tactical cloak and stealth to close the distance between themselves and their target.

#### Up Close and Personal

At 3rd level, when you apply your sneak attack damage from an attack made with a melee weapon, increase the damage die to d8.


#### Silent Cloak

At 9th level, your Tactical Cloak dampens noise. You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your 
speed on the same turn.

#### Melee Prowess

Starting at 9th level, your skill with melee weapons becomes unmatched. You have +1 to melee weapon attack and damage rolls.


#### Shadow Strike

At 13th level, whenever you activate Tactical Cloak you may teleport to a target location within 10m. You must be able to see the location
and it cannot be occupied by a creature or object. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

When you arrive at the target location, you may use your reaction to make one melee attack on a creature or object within
range. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your
Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.

The teleportation can be used to free you from movement impairing effects such as grapple, restrained, lifted, etc.


#### Death Strike

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a
failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.


### Sniper

Snipers are ranged specialists that have an affinity for sniper rifles.

#### Steady Aim

At the 3rd level, your aim with a sniper rifle becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can overclock 
your targeting system to take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a sniper rifle you're wielding.
Your ranged attacks with the sniper rifle gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On a hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your infiltrator level.

This effect lasts 1 minute or until you use Steady Aim on a different target.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

  style='width:285px; position: absolute;' />

```
```

#### Careful Eyes

Starting at 9th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action
as a bonus action.

You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).


#### Overwatch

At 13th level, you've become attuned to monitoring the movements of the battlefield, taking advantage of
when enemies break cover.

At the end of each of your turns, you may ready the following action. Choose up to 5 creatures you can see that are behind
half or three-quarter cover. Until the start of your next turn, if any of those creatures move into an area providing
no cover, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature. This attack can benefit from
your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target
more than once in a turn.


#### Killshot

At 17th level, your proficiency with sniper rifles is beyond measure allowing you to target the weakest points of your enemy.
When you apply your sneak attack damage to an attack made with a sniper rifle, add 3d6 to the damage roll.


### Saboteur

Saboteurs are tech savvy infiltrators that use cloak and dagger tactics to control the outcome of battles.

#### Saboteur's Touch

At 3rd level, you always have the sabotage spell prepared (it does not count against your list of prepared spells). Preparing the advanced
version of the spell counts as one spell, not two.

You can cast sabotage as a bonus action or as a reaction to a ranged weapon attack you can see.


#### Combat Heuristics

Starting at 3rd level, every time you bring an enemy to 0 hit points or score a critical hit, your HUD updates your tactical
feedback, restoring 1 tech point.


#### Tactical Ambush

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage
of any saving throw against the spell this turn.


#### Misdirection

Starting at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a 
creature within 2m of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target 
that creature instead of you.


#### Saboteur's Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take
two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn
at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.
