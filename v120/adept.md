## Adept

Adepts are biotic specialists, capable of disabling and killing enemies with raw biotic power. While they lack advanced combat training, they are the best at defeating enemies without firing a shot. They are outfitted with L5x implants that can spawn a micro-singularity, damaging enemies and pulling them into the air.


## Class Features

As a adept, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d6 per adept level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 6 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per adept level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

___
- __Armor__: Light armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose one from Melee or SMGs
- __Tools__: None
- __Saving Throws__: Charisma, Wisdom
- __Skills__: Choose three from Acrobatics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Sleight of hand,  and Survival

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- M-3 Predator or M-4 Shuriken
- Omni-Blade or Monomolecular Blade
- Stock Light Armor

```
```

### Spellcasting

Using your biotic implant or innate biotic talents, you can manipulate the mass of objects and space. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the adept spell list. You learn additional adept cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Adept table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.


#### Spell Slots
The Adept table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
adept spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

  style='width:300px' />


#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the adept spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more adept spells of your choice. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Adepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an Adept, you use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier




### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels,
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.


### Biotic Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than half your adept level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level adept, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Subclass
At 2nd level, choose a subclass which represents how you focus on your biotic talents: force, necrotic, or control effects.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Empowered Biotics

At 17th level, whenever you roll a 1 on a damage roll for a biotic spell or cantrip you cast, you can reroll the die and must use the 
new roll.

### Biotic Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain biotics that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level
biotic spells that you have learned. You can cast those spells at 1st level without
expending a spell slot. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

  style='width:285px; position: absolute; top: 260px' />

<div style='margin-top:320px'></div>



### Signature Biotics

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose 
two 1st or 2nd-level biotic spells you know as your signature biotics. You can cast each of them once at 2nd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at 3rd-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Subclasses

Adepts have three subclasses which revolve around your biotic specialty. Force experts, called commandos, focus on dealing
the maximum amount of damage through biotic powers. Blackstars are control experts and use powers like pull and singularity
to hinder enemy forces. Disruptors focus on the necrotic powers of biotics and can maintain powerful spells at great length.


### Commando

Commandos don't need heavy weapons because they ARE the heavy weapon. Their features improve both the damage potential and throughput of their biotic spells, making them a deadly force.

#### Pure Biotics

At 2nd level, your skill in dealing damage with biotic force powers becomes unmatched. Add your proficiency bonus to all force damage dealt by your biotic spells.


#### Expert Biotic

By 6th level, casting biotic spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your efforts. When you cast a 
biotic spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a 
level lower than the spell you cast.

#### Biotic Split

At 10th level, when you cast a biotic spell that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

#### Overchannel

Beginning at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler biotics. When you cast a biotic spell of 1st or 2nd level that deals damage, 
you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you 
take 2d12 psychic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again 
before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and 
immunity.


### Blackstar

Blackstars prefer controlling the battlefield over raw power. They can shape their biotic powers to avoid hurting friends and gain unique benefits to biotic control spells like Lift, Singularity, and Stasis.

#### Sculpt Biotics

Starting at 2nd level, You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your biotic spells. When you cast a biotic spell that 
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half 
damage on a successful save.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

#### Bend Luck

You've mastered the art of using small mass effect fields to slightly alter the outcome of other creature's actions. It 
might be a small burst under the muzzle of a gun to throw off the attacker's aim. Or negative field around a friendly 
creature as leaps away from a grenade, moving it out of damage's way.


At 6th level, when another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you 
can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. 
You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can use Bend Luck a number of times equal to half of your Adept level (minimum 1) before you finish a long rest.


#### Focused Biotics

Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a biotic spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.


#### Biotic Control

At 14th level, you've increased your mastery with biotic spells that control the battlefield. Gain the following 
benefits to the spells below:

___
- __Lift.__ When casting Lift, you are considered to have both advancement options. |
- __Pull.__ When you cast pull, you may target 2 creatures. Make a ranged spell attack for each target.
- __Singularity.__ Large or smaller objects and creatures are affected by singularity.
- __Stasis.__ Targets have disadvantage on their saving throw.


### Disruptor

Disruptors have learned to tap into dark energy, improving biotic abilities that tear apart their adversaries from within. They also specialize in maintaining spells with intense focus.

#### Dark Biotics

At 2nd level, your skill in dealing damage with withering biotic powers is unmatched. Add your proficiency bonus to all necrotic damage 
dealt by your biotic spells.


#### Biotic Surge

Starting at 6th level, you can empower your biotics that unleash harm on groups of foes. When you force multiple 
creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spell's damage by rolling 
two more of its damage dice. This increase occurs only on the turn you cast the spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Potent Biotics

At 10th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

```
```

#### Biotic Concentration

Starting at 14th level, you can push your biotic implant to the limit. If you are already maintaining a concentration 
spell, you can cast another spell that requires concentration and maintain it. If you take damage you must make a separate Constitution 
saving throw to maintain each spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
