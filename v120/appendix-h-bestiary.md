# Appendix H: Bestiary

A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its stat block, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster. There aren't enough spells and powers to justify making bonuses like "double damage to beast". In addition, many of the 5th Edition monster types don't make sense in the sci-fi setting (celestials, undead, fey, elemental, etc.). Instead, there are only three monster types: Organic, Synthetic, and Synthorganic.

## Bestiary List
The following list of creatures represents iconic enemy types from the first three Mass Effect games. They are grouped by factions and sorted by CR within their factions. Additional ideas can be found on the [n7.world](https://n7.world) website and also on the [Mass Effect 5e subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect5e/).
