### Adrenaline Rush

You can inject yourself with a shot of adrenaline, pushing yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
At 2nd level, you can take one additional action this turn on top of your regular action and a possible 
bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Starting at 17th level, you can use Adrenaline Rush twice per short rest but not more than once in a single turn.


### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. At 11th level, you can attack three times instead of once. At 20th level, you can attack four times instead of once.


### Tactical Reload

By 7th level, you're so familiar with guns that reloading them is nothing more than muscle memory. Once per turn, if the heat of a 
weapon your holding becomes 0, you can use your Reaction to take the Reload action for that weapon.


### Indomitable

At 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature 
again until you finish a Long Rest. 

You can use this feature once between long rests. At 13th level, you can use this feature twice between long rests. At 17th level, you can use this feature three times between long rests.

## Subclasses

Soldiers have three subclasses which revolve around their weapon specialty.

### Havoc

GUNS!!! GRENADES!!! EXPLOSIONS!!!

#### Advanced Weapon Holsters

You've outfitted your armor with special rigs that make carrying weapons a cinch. 

At 3rd level, you have 2 additional weapon slots that are capable of holstering two-handed weapons. 
If using the Encumbrance (Variant) rule, your carry weight is doubled.

#### Makeshift Grenades

When you reach 3rd level, you can program your omni-tool to transform omni-gel into grenades. Choose two grenades from the grenade
list. As an action, you can spend 1 omni-gel to create and use a grenade of that type. The Mark of the grenade you create
is equal to your soldier level divided by 3 (rounded down).

You can spend 8 hours of programming to exchange a selected grenade with a different one.


#### Advanced Combat Powers

Starting at 7th level, when you learn a new combat power, you automatically learn one of the advanced
options for it. For each combat power you have already learned, pick an advanced option for it. If you have already learned
an advanced option, you may learn and advance a new combat power.


#### Heavy Weapon Hack

Starting at 10th level, when your heavy weapon runs out of ammo, you can jerry-rig an additional charge for 2 omni-gel.

#### Makeshift Grenades

At 15th level, you can have 4 grenades programmed into your Omni-tool at once.

In addition, you can create a grenade with this ability as a bonus action and you can use a grenade as an attack action.

#### Paint by Number

At 18th level, you become a heavy weapon artist and a targeting laser is your paintbrush. When using a Heavy Weapon that requires a round of targeting, you may target and fire on the same turn.



### Weapon Master

Weapon masters train extensively in the art of a single weapon, giving them powerful advantages when using a weapon of that type.

#### Weapon of Choice

By 3rd level, you have undergone extensive training with a single weapon type. Choose a weapon type which becomes your Weapon of Choice. 
When you are holding your Weapon of Choice you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. 
You may spend 1 month of intensive training to exchange your Weapon of Choice with another weapon type.

__Superiority Dice__: You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 
You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a weapon attack against a creature with your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of 
the attack are applied.
* When you damage a creature with a weapon attack from your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution 
saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.
* When you are hit by a melee attack, if you are currently holding your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority 
die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.



#### Strafe

At 7th level, when you take the Dash or Disengage action, you can make 1 weapon attack with your Weapon of Choice as a bonus action at 
any point during your movement.


#### Weapon of Choice

You gain another superiority die (5 total) at 10th level and the die type becomes a d10.


#### Devastating Critical

Starting at the 15th level, when you score a critical hit with your Weapon of Choice, you gain a bonus to that 
weapon's damage roll equal to your soldier level.

#### Weapon of Choice

You gain another superiority die (6 total) at 18th level and the die type becomes a d12.



### Gladiator

Gladiators are pure-combatants, focused on winning at all costs and being nearly impossible to take down.

#### Fighting Spirit

Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on
your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so,
you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this
class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Vengeance

Starting at 7th level, you can overcome grievous injuries. When you would make a death
saving throw, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of adrenaline. You immediately stand up (if you so
choose), and you regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Then, you may draw any weapon you are carrying,
choose a target a creature within that weapon's normal range, and make 2 attacks with the weapon.

If the target creature is the same one that reduced you to 0 or fewer hit points, you have advantage on both attack rolls.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Tireless Spirit

Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.


#### Additional Fighting Style

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

#### Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack 
against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the 
same target as a bonus action.


#### Strength before Death

Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you
to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can
immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking
damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the
extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
