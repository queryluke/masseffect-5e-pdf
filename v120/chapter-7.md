# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

<div style='margin-left: 60px; margin-top: -65px'>
- __Strength__, measuring physical power
- __Dexterity__, measuring agility
- __Constitution__, measuring endurance
- __Intelligence__, measuring reasoning and memory
- __Wisdom__, measuring perception and insight
- __Charisma__, measuring force of personality
</div>

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these
qualities - a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. 

The three main rolls of the game - the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll - rely on the six ability scores. The Introduction describes the basic
rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the
total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not
just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related
to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but operatives and many monsters are a cut above average in most
abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. operatives can have scores as high as 20, and
monsters can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a
score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores,
from 1 to 30.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

```
```

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw,
or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you
have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and
a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more
than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and
you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice
versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the volus' Lucky trait, lets you reroll the
d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a volus has advantage or disadvantage on
an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the volus could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells.
Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide
that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.


## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their
stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different
rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when
you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.
For example, the infiltrator’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or
divide it only once.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>


\page

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that
wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check, your
proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency
in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make
Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows
you to do so, these same rules apply.


## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The
GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance
of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of
the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes
table shows the most common DCs.


##### Typical Difficulty Classes

<span style='font-size:11px;'>Task Difficulty</span>|<span style='font-size:11px;'>DC</span>
:---|:---:
Very Easy|5
Easy|10
Medium|15
Hard|20
Very Hard|25
Nearly impossible|30

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and
penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success -
the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes
no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.


### Contests
Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are
trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a grenade that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal - for example,
when a brute tries to force open a door that an operative is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a __contest__.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and
penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with
the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other
one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might
win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a grenade the floor, neither character grabs it.
In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an operative trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that
the door remains shut.


### Skills
Mass Effect 5e is a sci-fi setting, thus some of the fantasy skills (like religion and arcana) have been replaced with new
skills.

___
- __Removed Skills__: _Animal Handling_, _Arcana_, _Nature_, _Religion_
___
- __New Skills__: _Electronics_, _Engineering_, _Science_, _Vehicle Handling_

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in.
A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a
focus on that aspect. A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's
skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or
to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,
respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related
to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. No skills are related to Constitution. See an
ability's description in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/appendix/skills">Appendix: Skills</nuxt-link> for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

\page

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”
At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,
proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If
the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character
lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

<br>

>##### Variant: Paragon & Renegade
>In Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the Variant: Paragon & Renegade rules (see chapter 4).
>This new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is _Paragon-ish_
>or _Renegade-ish_.

<br>
### Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the
average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when
the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a
hidden sniper.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

<div style='font-size:11px; text-align: center;font-family:sans-serif'>
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
</div>

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check
total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the "Dexterity" section below rely on passive checks, as do
the exploration rules.

### Working together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the
highest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.
In combat, this requires the __Help__ action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a
security system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another
character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some
tasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.
In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,
the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters
succeed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group
Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the
environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of
danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.



## Using Each Ability
Every task that an operative might attempt in the game is covered by on of the size abilities.

### Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or
to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

__*Athletics*__. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, Jumping, or swimming.

__*Other Strength Checks*__. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
  - Break free of bonds
  - Push through a tunnel that is too small
  - Hang on to a hover car while being dragged behind it
  - Tip over a dormant mech
  - Restraining an elcor

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as
an omni-hammer, a monomolecular blade, or a krogan warhammer. Additionally, ranged weapon marked with the _Recoil_ property
allow you to overcome the kickback of the weapon with brute force. You may apply your Strength modifier to your attack roll
and damage roll when attacking with _Recoil_ weapons.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>


\page

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
These weights have been adjusted from 5th Edition to work with kilograms (kg) instead of pounds (lbs).

__*Carry Capacity*__. You can carry capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 5. If you are wearing armor, your carry
capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 10 (due to the built-in servos and pneumatics). This score is not affected
by weapons or armor (see below).

__*Push, Drag, Lift*__. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in kgs up to twice your carrying capacity or 10 (20 w/ armor)
times your Strength score. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 2 meters.

__*Size & Strength*__. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category
above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

__*Weapons*__. You have 4 weapon slots and can equip a single weapon in any slot. _Two-handed_ weapons require 2 weapon slots. Weapons equipped in a slot do not affect your carry capacity. Any additional weapons you pick up count against your carry capacity.

__*Armor*__. The Armor Bonuses and Limitations table has a minimum Strength score for the combination of armor types. You
must meet or exceed that score. See the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5.


#### Variant: Encumbrance

The lifting and carrying rules attempt to keep the simplicity of 5th edition, with the added restrictions of weapon capacity. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the minimum Strength column of the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5 and ignore the weapon slot limitation.

- __Your carry weight is equal to two times your Strength score__
- Each weapon and armor piece has a weight. If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of your
  carry weight, you are __encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 4m.
- If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of four times your Strength score, you are instead
  __heavily encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 10m and you have disadvantage on ability
  checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.




### Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.
The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth and Vehicle Handling skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

__*Acrobatics*__. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking spaceship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

__*Sleight of Hand*__. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

__*Stealth*__. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

__*Vehicle Handling*__. If you're driving a vehicle you're familiar with, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity (Vehicle) check to make a difficult maneuver or avoid heavy weapon fire, crash land, or weave between traffic. However, if you are unfamiliar with a vehicle, the GM would require a Wisdom (Vehicle Handling) check to see if you can pilot the vehicle at all.

__*Other Dexterity Checks*__. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Disable a tripwire mine
  - Securely tie up a prisoner
  - Wriggle free of bonds
  - Play a stringed instrument
  - Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as an
assault rifle or a sub-machine gun (SMG). You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the _finesse_ property, such as an omni-blade or a monomolecular blade.

#### Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class. See the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5.

#### Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of
creatures' turns in combat.

#### Hiding
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until 
you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that 
actively searches for signs of your presence.



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>


\page



You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as 
shouting a warning or bumping into a crate. An _invisible_ creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still 
be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature,
it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature
that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

__Passive Perception__. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine
whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the
creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency
bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
of 14.

__What Can You See?__ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how
well you can see in an area, which might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__.


### Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability
represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.
A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire pint of Batarian Shard Wine in one gulp
- Resist the effect of poison

#### Hit Points
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each
Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from
1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier
increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add
3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier.
Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1,
your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.



### Intelligence
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The
Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, and Science skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

__*Electronics*__. Your Intelligence (Electronics) check covers attempts to hack or interface with computer systems, such as when you're trying to open locked doors and containers, turn off cameras, override controls, etc.

__*Engineering*__. Your Intelligence (Engineering) check covers your knowledge of machines and mechanical devices. It most cases it determines your ability to repair devices. But you might also use it to spot weaknesses in mechanical defense systems, spot potential vehicle failures before they happen, or find expensive parts in space salvage.

__*History*__. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient or alien races and their cultures or customs, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

__*Investigation*__. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in Search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

__*Science*__. Your Intelligence (Science) check measures your ability to make useful connections and correlations based on the wealth of knowledge that can be found on the exonet. In a sense, it measures your 'scientific mindset'. A GM might ask for a check when encountering unknown flora or fauna, assessing the geology of an alien world, or analyzing natural or unnatural phenomena.

__*Other Intelligence Checks*__. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Estimate the value of a piece of tech
  - Create a false ID badge
  - Forge an electronic document
  - Recall lore about an ancient civilization
  - Win a game of skill


#### Spellcasting Ability
Engineers, infiltrators, and some sentinels use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.




<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

### Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.


#### Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the
environment, or care for an injured person. The Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude
in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

__*Insight*__. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body Language, Speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

__*Medicine*__. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion, diagnose an illness, or understand the biology of an organism.

__*Perception*__. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss.

__*Survival*__. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to survive in uncivilized alien words, especially harsh environments like tundra, deserts, or jungles. The check might help you navigate a blizzard, find food in a wasteland, or avoid getting eaten by a Thresher Maw.

__*Other Wisdom Checks*__. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
  - Discern whether a seemingly life-like android is organic or synthetic

#### Spellcasting Ability
Adepts, vanguards, and some sentinels use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.


### Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence,
and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or
tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance,
and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

__Deception__. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, or dull someone's suspicions with false assurances.

__*Intimidation*__. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

__*Performance*__. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

__*Persuasion*__. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a politician to let your party see the councilor, negotiating peace between warring krogan tribes, or inspiring a crowd of colonist.

__*Other Charisma Checks*__. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
  - Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability
Asari and some sentinels Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.

## Saving Throws
A __saving throw__ - also called a save - represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a
similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or
monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity
modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage,
as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The engineer, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves.
As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving
throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving
throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a
successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
