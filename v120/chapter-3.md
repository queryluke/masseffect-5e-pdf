# Chapter 3: Classes
Operatives are extraordinary beings, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are 
heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand 
against. 

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. 
Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and beings
in the galaxy. A soldier, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as 
just a pawn in a much larger game. An infiltrator, by contrast, might see himself as a willing agent in a governments’s 
unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various races. While the soldier has contacts in a mercenary group or army, the 
infiltrator might know a number of politicians, spies, and double agents. 

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a soldiers’s mastery of weapons and armor, and an adepts’s spells. 
At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing 
features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, 
and a detailed explanation of each one. 

There are only 6 classes in Mass Effect, each is either a specialist of hybird of two other classes. Adepts are biotic
masters and play similarly to wizards, focusing on spellcasting and control. Engineers are versatile tech masters with 
a wide range of tech powers and some healing capabilities, a mix of hunter, monk, and cleric. Soldiers are weapon masters
and are closely aligned with fighters from 5th edition. Sentinels are defensive tanks with the capability of casting both
biotic and tech spells, the paladins of the group. Infiltrators are very similar to rogues, utilizing tech from engineers 
and martial prowess from soldiers. Finally, vanguards are a kind of barbarian spellcaster, with combat capabilities of a 
soldier, but devastating biotics of an adept.

Operatives sometimes advance in more than one class. An engineer might switch direction in life and join a mercenary group
like the Blue Suns, becoming more proficient with weapons and armor, taking a few levels of a soldier. An asari infiltrator
may decide to focus on their biotic talents, taking some levels in adept or vanguard. Optional rules for combining classes in 
this way, called multiclassing, can be found in chapter 6.
