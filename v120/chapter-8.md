# Chapter 8: Missions

This section covers the basics of the operative's live, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social
interaction. The rules for resting are also in this section, along with a discussion of the activities your character might
pursue between missions.

Whether operatives are exploring an ancient alien ruin or the busy streets of the Citadel, the game follows a natural
rhythm, as outlined in the introduction:

1. The GM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the mission, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore docking bays
or jungle planets. The GM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the operatives find as they enter each
new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the operatives’ actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a
timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

## Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The
GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a space station environment,
the operatives' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,
another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the room
beyond for anything interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Operatives eager to reach the lonely base camp at
the foot of a mountain hurry across those 30 kilometers in just under four hours' time (or less if they're using a vehicle).

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Making mass relay jumps from Sol to the outer skirts of the Terminus Systems,
the operatives spend four uneventful days before a batarian ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time.


## Movement

Spacewalking along the surface of an asteroid, sneaking down a space station corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain
slope - all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the operatives' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through
the dusty desert of Turchanka and find a small outpost late in the evening of the third day." Even in a space station,
particularly a large station or an asteroid colony, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: "After subduing the
guards at the entrance to the underground research facility, you consult your omni-tool, which leads you through
miles of echoing corridors to a large arena with caged varren."

Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in
days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the
creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.

### Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in meters that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.
This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules
determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

Mass Effect 5e uses meters instead of feet.
>##### 5ft = 2m
<br>
>##### On a playmat: 2m = 1 square

<br>

### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of operatives can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The
table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes
characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

__Forced March.__
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace,
and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

__Mounts and Vehicles__. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted
character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are
available every 12 to 15 kilometers (8-10 miles), characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very
rare except in densely populated areas.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | MISSIONS</div>



\page

Characters in transports choose a pace as normal. The __range__ statistic on transports indicates how far the transport can
travel in a 24 hour period for a _normal_ pace. If you're moving at a fast pace, you can double the range and half it for a
slow pace. Transports do not suffer exhaustion as a living mount would, but characters still need to pilot the vehicle.
In general, characters can only pilot vehicle for 16 hours at a time before needing to rest.

More details about traveling in transports and starships are provided in chapter 10.

|slow|60m<br>(~200 ft)|3km<br>(~2 miles)|30km (~18 miles)|Able to use stealth

#### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear corridors.
But operatives can face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled craters, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground -
all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain - moving 1 meter in difficult terrain costs 2 meters of speed - so you can
cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### +/- Gravity 
Operatives may find themselves in an environment with little, no, or increased gravity. For any increase (or decrease) that
is twice as more (or less) than your operatives normal working gravity, use the difficult terrain rules. If your
operative normally works in a 1g environment, and enters a .5g or 2g environment, they are considered to be in difficult terrain.

If you're in a low gravity environment, your long and high jump distances are doubled. Jump distances are halved in higher
gravity.

When in a 0g environment, your speed becomes 0, unless you have a means of propelling yourself. Additional rules, such as
disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws or melee attacks, are decided by the GM based on the context of your environment.

```
```

### Special Types of Movement
Movement through underground tunnels, skyscrapers, or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Operatives
might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.


#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
While climbing or swimming, each meter of movement costs 1 extra meter (2 extra meters in difficult terrain), unless a
creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few
handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require
a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Jumping <v-chip color="orange accent-2" text-color="black" class="v-chip--x-small">change</v-chip>
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

__Long Jump__. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of meters up to your Strength score divided by three (rounded up)
if you move at least 4 meters on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance.
Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option,
you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance),
such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

__High Jump__. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of meters equal to 1 + your Strength modifier divided by three
(rounded up) if you move at least 4m on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can
jump only half that distance. Either way, each meter you clear on the jump costs a meter of movement. In some circumstances,
your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal
to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.

## The Environment
Going on missions can involve delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of environmental hazards. The rules
in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

### Falling
A fall from a great height is a common hazard, especially since many urban environments reach the skies. At the end of a
fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 4 meters (~10 ft) it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit
points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2
rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Space 
The vacuum of space will kill any organic (and most synthorganic creatures) in a matter of minutes unless that creature
has some specific resilience to surviving in a vacuum. A creature in the vacuum of space without an appropriate environmental
suit will remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). After that time passes,
the creature immediate becomes incapacitated and it can survive in space a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution
modifier (minimum 1) after which it dies.

### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and
targeting a biotic power, to name just a few - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects
that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__. In a __lightly obscured__ area, such as dim light, patchy fog,
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A __heavily obscured__ area - such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage - blocks vision entirely. A creature
effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: __bright light__, __dim light__,
and __darkness__.

__Bright light__ lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, fires, and
other sources of illumination within a specific radius.


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/9/99/Codex_MEA_-_Habitat_7.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/309?cb=20180926131330' 
  style='width:225px; margin-left:30px' />

__Dim light__, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between
a source of bright light, such as a flashlight, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts
as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon (or moons) might bathe the surface of a planet in dim light.

__Darkness__ creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night, within the confines of a derelict
starship, or a subterranean ruin.

#### Blindsight
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures
without eyes, such as thresher maws, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and yaghs, have
this sense.

#### Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision and some gear can provide darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision
can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that
creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Truesight
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal darkness, see invisible creatures and objects that
are hidden by technological means (such as tactical cloak).

#### Infrared vision
A creature with infrared vision, out to a specific range, can see in darkness, is unaffected by lightly or heavily obscured
areas, and see invisible and hidden creatures and objects that give off heat.

However, the creature cannot see beyond intense heat sources and is effectively blind when looking at an intense heat source.

### Food and Water
Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be
removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

#### Food
A character needs about 500 grams (~ 1lb) of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.
Eating 250 grams of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the
end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating
resets the count of days without food to zero.

#### Water
A character needs 2 liters (~ 1/2 gallon) of water per day, or 4 liters per day if the weather is hot. A character who
drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at
the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end
of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Interacting with Objects
A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM
that his or her character is doing something, such as interacting with a terminal, and the GM describes what, if anything,
happens.

For example, a character might decide to interact with a terminal, which might, in turn, open a door, raise an alarm, or
give the character access to a map of the building. If the terminal is protected via security, though, a character might need
to hack it. In such a situation, the GM might call for an Intelligence (Electronics) check to see whether the character can
bypass the security. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons, biotics, and tech. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage,
but otherwise, they can be affected by physical attacks much as creatures can. The GM determines an object's Armor Class
and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks.
(It's hard to cut a cable with a hammer, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and
they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

```
```

## Social Interaction
Exploring planets, overcoming obstacles, and surviving death squads are key parts of Mass Effect missions. No less important,
though, are the social interactions that operatives have with other inhabitants of the galaxy.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous spy to confess to some malfeasance, or you
might try to flatter a shop owner so they will give you a discount. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are
participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a
__nonplayer character__ (NPC).

In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are
predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a
friendly NPC, of course.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/d/d9/Codex_MEA_-_Outlaws_folder_%2B_Sloane_main.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/309?cb=20181004070222' 
  style='width:225px; margin-left:30px; margin-top: 20px;' />


### Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character
thinks, acts, and talks.

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s
quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most
players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | MISSIONS</div>


\page

#### Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental
image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:

- Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
- Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.
- Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.
- Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing
what you see in your mind.

#### Active Approach to Roleplaying
If descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying
shows them.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even
echo your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though
you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.

#### Results of Roleplaying
The GM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats
of violence. A stubborn turian refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain asari laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality.
You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence
the NPC’s attitude.

Interactions in Mass Effect 5e are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten
them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want.
On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a politician’s allies, your efforts to convince or
deceive will fall short.


### Ability Checks
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation.
For example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM’s discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in
your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a security guard
into letting them into a classified area, the infiltrator who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the
discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the sentinel with Persuasion should do most of the talking.

## Resting
Heroic though they might be, operatives can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction,
and combat. They need rest - time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, clean their weapons, practice biotic spells, and configure
omni-tools.

Operatives can take short rests in the midst of mission day and a long rest to end the day.

### Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than
eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice,
which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the
character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to
spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest,
as explained below.

### Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light
activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period
of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting biotics, or similar activity - the characters must
begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a
number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character
has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit
point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.


## Between Missions

Between trips to remote planets and battles against reaper forces, operatives need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare
for their next mission. Many operatives also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting or modding arms and
armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned credits.

In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new mission,
the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your
character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond
your perception stay in motion.



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | MISSIONS</div>


\page



### Lifestyle Expenses
Between missions, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other
individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to
influence the officials of the city than if you live in poverty. Lifestyle expenses are further explained in the Expenses
section of chapter 5.


### Downtime Activities
Between missions, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can
vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit,
and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be
consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer
period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her
downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

#### Crafting
You can craft weapons, mods, armor, other equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the
object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations
necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armorsmith's tools needs a source of power and intense heat
in order to craft armor or install mods.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 500 credits,
and you must expend raw materials or omni-gel worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market
value greater than 500 credits, you make progress every day in 500-credit increments until you reach the market value of
the item. For example, Blood Dragon Armor (market value 101,300 credits) takes 203 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all
have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1000 credits
worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
proficiency and the proper facilities can craft the Blood Dragon Armor in 68 days, at a total cost of 50,650 credits.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day, or a comfortable
lifestyle at half the normal cost.

```
```

#### Practicing a Profession
You can work between missions, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 150 credits per day.
This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide
gainful employment you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn
enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

#### Recuperating
You can use downtime between missions to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,
you can choose one of the following results:

- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

#### Researching
The time between missions is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over
the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over the exonet, buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and
gossip from their lips, or paying for information from certain factions like the Shadow Broker Network.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will
take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual,
file, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation)
check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid,
or an Intelligence (Electronics) check to hack into a database. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information
if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 100 credits to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your
normal lifestyle expenses.

#### Training
You can spend time between missions training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more
ability checks are required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 100 credits per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
you gain proficiency with the new tool.
