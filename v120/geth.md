## Geth
Former automatons build by the quarians to function as soldiers and laborers, geth are constructs that have 
unintentionally consciousness and sentience. Geth, meaning "servant of the people" in the quarian language of 
Khelish, are fundamentally different than other constructs and are designed with humanoid thought and emotion in mind.
Geth think, feel, and experience the world in a totally unique way.

### The Morning War
"Does this unit have a soul?" asked the geth. That question would change the relationship of quarians and geth forever. 
The quarians responded with an attempted termination of all geth. The newly sentient geth resisted the genocide of 
their masters in a war dubbed "the Morning War". As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly 
and easily defeated. Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their 
homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.

### Incomprehensible Mind
Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds 
powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic 
minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come 
to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. 
Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their 
innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even 
the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.

### Beyond the Veil
Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the 
Terminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. 
The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other 
quests.

### Geth Names
Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races. 
However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as "us" and "we". 
As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those 
who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though 
they give themselves a more personally fitting name.

### Geth Traits
From a common build, geth share traits based on the mold from which they were formed.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

__Age__. Geth do not age, as they are constructs, and live as long as their bodies are not destroyed.

__Alignment__. Your standard Geth platform is neutral good, wanting to prosper and communicate with others, defending themselves only if threatened. Heretics are lawful evil, serving the Reapers and slavishly accomplishing their will.

__Size__. Standard geth are around 2 meters tall (6'5"). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 2d10 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__No Feats__. Geth cannot take any feats.


__Living Construct__. You are immune to psychic and poison damage, the poisoned condition, and disease. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping.
In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

<span style='padding-left: 12px;'>
__Integrated Protection__. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor,
but if you are wielding a weapon or shield that provides additional AC, you apply its bonus as normal.
</span>

You can alter your armor type for 2 omni-gel each time you finish a long rest. Choose one mode to adopt from the
Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode’s prerequisite.

<span style='font-size:12px;'>Mode</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>Prerequisite</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>AC</span>
:--- | :--- | ---
Lithe | None | 11 + your Dexterity Modifier. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Composite Plating | Medium armor proficiency | 12 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + proficiency bonus
Asymmetric Defense Plating | Heavy armor proficiency | 15 + proficiency bonus. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

__Innate Shielding.__ You have 5 shields (regen 5). You can upgrade these by using armor mods.

__Armor Mods.__ You can augment your armor by integrating armor mods into your system. You can spend 8 hours removing, adding, or
replacing a mod. When you remove or replace a mod in this way, the replaced or removed mod is lost. The mod cannot be salvaged,
not even with the assistance of Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools.

You have 2 chest mod slots, 1 mod slot in your arms, legs, and head each. You cannot add new slots in any way.

__Hunter Mode__. Geth were designed as lethal weapons and can activate subroutines to enhance their lethality.

As an action, you can activate Hunter Mode which lasts 1 minute and can only be used once
per long rest. Hunter Mode grants the following benefits:

- Increase movement by 2m.
- +1 bonus to ranged and melee weapon attack rolls.


At 11th level, you gain an additional benefit based on your class:

- *Engineer*. When you cast a spell, the die type of that spell increases by 1 die type (max d12). If the die type is already d12, add +1 for each die rolled instead.
- _Soldier_. Your extra attack features grants you 1 additional attack the first time you take the Attack action on your turn.
- _Infiltrator._ Increase your sneak attack die type to d8 (if you are a Shadow Infiltrator, your sneak attack for melee weapons attacks is a d10).


__Repair Matrix__. As a construct, you cannot be healed by medi-gel or spells that heal organic creatures (such as the _first aid_ spell).

Instead, you can use your Action to expend a Hit Die. Roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain 
hit points equal to the total. You also regain all spent hit dice at the end of a long rest, instead of the usual amount.

If you drop to 0 hit points, you must be stabilized with an Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Electronics) check, 
instead of a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

At the 4th level, you gain an additional number of hit dice equal to your character level divided by 4 (minimum 1). 
These bonus hit dice are d8s, regardless of your class.



### Variant: Unshackled AI

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. 
Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer 
called a "blue box". While most AI are "shackled" to the confines of networked computer traffic and lack a body,
occasionally, an AI is placed into a synthetic form, unshackling it.

AIs are considered illegal by the Council, but that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus from innovating. As an 
unshackled AI, you might be have been mass produced like the Alliance Infiltration Units, or you may be an experiment 
gone wrong.

#### Playing an Unshackled AI
Unshackled AIs are entirely unique. Since you are synthetic, you gain some of the synthetic traits as listed in the
Geth description. However, your mind, purpose, history, alignment, height, weight, and personality are entirely
your own. Technically, you can take any form you wish (work with your GM to decide if this new form gains any additional
traits). However, because AI are illegal, most unshackled AI would have a humanoid form, allowing them to blend into
society.

#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an Unshackled AI, you can choose to replace the _Ability Score Increase_, _Alignment_,
_Hunter Mode_, and _No Feats_ traits with the following.

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, one other score of your choosing that is not Intelligence increases by 1.

__Alignment__. If you are still following your programming you would be lawful with morality based on your purpose. If you have a glitch in your programming you might be chaotic. 

__Feat__. You gain one feat of your choice.
