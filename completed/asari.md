## Asari

Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a 
crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or 
gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction 
initiated by a "mind meld" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to 
randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to 
manipulate mass effect fields.

### Unmatched Patience
Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a "long view" not common in other races. When they encounter a new 
species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.
They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will 
inevitably influence the existing culture.

### Mothers of the Galaxy
Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the 
asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of 
DNA. 


The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, 
the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and 
as a "map" to randomize the genes of the offspring.

Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the "father" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown 
upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so 
it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as 
"purebloods", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes 
asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.

### Maiden, Matron, Matriarch
Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. 

The __Maiden__ stage 
begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and 
it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. 

The __Matron__ 
stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This 
period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. 

The __Matriarch__ stage begins around 700 years 
of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, 
dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.

However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity. 

### Asari Names
Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari 
parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with 
their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as "Matriarch" but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.

### Asari Traits
Your asari character has an assortment of inborn abilities, all part of asari nature.

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. Asari are very long-lived and can reach ages of over 1000 years.

__Alignment__. Asari are biased towards goodness, but exhibit a range of alignments not dissimilar to humans. Most Maiden stage asari are chaotic, Matrons level out to neutral, Matriarchs are heavily lawful.

__Size__. Asari have builds incredibly similar to female humans. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d4 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Innate Biotics__. Asari do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability
to project their will onto the world. As an Asari, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.

Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that classâ€™s spell list. In addition,
choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast
it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of
the spell as your class permits.


__Mind Meld__. You can transfer and receive thoughts to another creature. You must concentrate and if the creature is not willing,
the thoughts become jumbled and disjointed. Unintelligent creatures have unpredictable results.


__Natural Diplomat__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.


### Variant: Ardat-Yakshi

A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in "purebloods" (2 asari parents).
The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct.
When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi 
develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addition only grows stronger with each meld, 
and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to leave in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to 
avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.


#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, you can choose to replace the _Alignment_ and _Mind Meld_ traits with the following.
Additionally, you gain the _Dominate_ trait at 10th level.

__Alignment__. Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.

__Mind Break__. You can touch a willing creature and initiate a mind meld. If the target is unwilling, the meld does not continue. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be 
rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a long rest.

__Dominate__. At 10th level, you learn the Dominate spell. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for this spell and it 
does not count against your max number spells known or prepared. You can cast a 3rd-level version of this spell
once per long rest.
