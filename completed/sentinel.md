## Sentinel

The Sentinel is able to combine tech and biotics to manipulate the environment, disable and track enemies, or defend the party. In addition to complete weapons training, Sentinels are equipped with an advanced shield that makes taking cover much less necessary and rushing their enemies much more productive. Because Sentinels have access to both biotic spells and tech powers and use Charisma as their spellcasting modifier.

### Spellcasting
Your Lt5 is the source of your spellcasting capabilities. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the sentinel spell list. You learn additional sentinel cantrips of your choice
at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sentinel table.

#### Spell Slots
The Sentinel table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of
your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell
slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell lance, you must spend
one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sentinel spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn more sentinel spells of your choice of 1st level
and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new sentinel spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Sentinels use a unique L5t biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents.
As a sentinel you choose your spellcasting modifier from Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. 

- Choosing Charisma means that your operative has immense willpower and uses it to overcome the mental strain of casting 
  biotic spells and interfacing with their omni-tool. They use their innate talent to maximize the potency of their spells.
- Choosing Intelligence means that your operative takes advantage of their omni-tool, using it to assist in the casting
  of biotic spells. Their keen intellect helps them choose strategic targets to maximize the potency of their spells.
- Choosing Wisdom means that your operative has unmatched concentration and can use the physical mnemonics of their
  biotic implant to cast tech spells with their omni-tool. Their patience and insight maximizes the potency of their spells.

You use your selected ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your selected
ability's modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

### Tech Armor

You've bolstered your armor with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage,
activate your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier with additional hit points equal to the sum of your sentinel level
and spellcasting modifier, multiplied by 2. When you have tech armor hit points and take damage, the tech armor hit points 
are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your shields and/or normal hit points. Tech armor lasts 1 minute 
or until it has 0 hit points remaining.

While tech armor is active, you can use your action to overload it. Each creature within 4m must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor, 
or half as much on a successful one.

You can use Tech Armor twice between long rests.

```
```

### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level (whichever is highest),
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, choose a fighting style from the list below.

#### Assault
When you make a Burst Fire attack, the DC of the saving throw is 17.

#### Brawler
Add your proficiency bonus to your melee attack damage rolls.

#### Carnage
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Close-Quarters Shooter
When making a ranged attack while you are within 2m of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half-cover against targets within 10m of you.

#### Defense

#### Gunslinger
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light ranged weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light ranged weapon that you’re holding in the other hand.

#### The Free Hand
When holding no more than one light, non-two-handed weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to hit with ranged spell attacks

```
```
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.

#### Sniper
If no hostile creature is within 10m of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks made with a sniper rifle.


### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Quick Cast

At 6th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you may make a weapon attack as a
bonus action.


### L5t Implant (3rd-level)

At the 11th level, choose one spell and an advancement for that spell of 3rd-level or less. You can cast this
spell once as a 3rd-level spell without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

### L5t Implant (4th-level)

At the 13th level and again at 15th level, choose one spell and an advancement for that spell of 4th-level or less. You can cast this
spell once as a 4th-level spell without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

### L5t Implant (5th-level)

At the 17th level, choose one spell and an advancement for that spell of 5th-level or less. You can cast this
spell once as a 5th-level spell without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.


### Reset

At 20th level, you can draw power from the depths of exhaustion. If you spend one minute calming your mind or recalibrating
your armor you can regain all of your expended spell slots or all spent uses of your tech armor. Once you use this feature,
you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Subclasses
Sentinels have three subclasses which reflect their connection with their Tech Armor. Bastion sentinels forego upgrading their tech armor for leadership on the battlefield. Juggernauts focus entirely on defense and can take an impressive amount of damage. Guardians prefer to boost their allies with unique subroutines and keep themselves safe with an omni-shield.

### Bastion

Bastion sentinels are battlefield leaders. They can easily turn the tides by calling out orders, inspiring troops, and synchronizing troop movements.

#### Tactical Focus

At 3rd level, your tactical acumen and predictive VI algorithms allow you to provide direction to your
allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action, you can select an area within 30m on the ground that measures 6m on each side. This area is your tactical focus.
It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you become <condition id="incapacitated"/>.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three
tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 14th level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can
swap one of your tactics for a different one.

Additionally, at 7th level the size of your tactical focus becomes 8m on each side. At 14th level the size becomes 10m on each side.

  style='width:300px; position: absolute; bottom: 50px; left: 50px' />


```
```

#### Tactics
Choose from the following tactics.

__Advance__.
Update your allies' HUDs and outline optimal routes to your tactical focus. If an ally spends all of its movement
moving towards your tactical focus, it doubles its movement, ignores difficult terrain, and does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.

__Analysis__.
Focus all of your attention on the movements and capabilities of a single enemy. When you choose this tactic, you
additionally choose a single hostile creature within your tactical focus. Beginning when you set your tactical focus
and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, the DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or
inferior in regard to one of the following characteristics of your choice: One ability score (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom), Armor Class, or Current hit points

__Clear the area__.
Pick out weak spots on your targets that force them out of your tactical focus. If an ally hit s a creature in your
tactical focus with a weapon attack, the ally can move that creature 2m.

__Heads up__.
If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it has advantage on that saving throw.

__Pin down__.
When a hostile creature attempts to move out of your tactical focus, two target creatures of your choice can use
a reaction to make an attack of opportunity on the target. If both attacks are successful, the creature's movement becomes
0, it falls prone and remains in your tactical focus.

__Recon__.
Your VI focuses on the movement of dust and augments sound from your area of focus, reconstructing a perfect image on your
and your allies' HUD. Any creature within your tactical focus loses any benefits from being invisible, lightly obscured,
or heavily obscured.


#### Master Tactician

At 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking
a creature, the target of that attack can be within 20m of you, rather than 2m of you, if the target can see or hear you.


#### Ever Ready

By 7th level, you've learned to never let your guard down. You have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your
first turn, but only if you activate your tactical focus, selecting an area that encompasses your location, before doing
anything else on that turn.

#### Call the Shots

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to focus all of your attention on your tactical focus, calling out
threats, troop movements, and enemy weaknesses.

Until the start of your next turn:

- Whenever a friendly creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and adds the result to its attack roll or saving throw.
- Whenever a hostile creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and subtracts the result to its attack roll or saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended
uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Tactical Maneuvers

At 14th level, you can provide leadership that allows your allies to move in perfect harmony.

In place of moving, you can instead allow up to three allies within 30m move up to half their speed. The chosen allies
must be capable of taking actions in order to move in this manner.


#### Synchronized Assault

Starting at 18th level, you gain the ability to unleash a devastating combination of your allies' abilities. As a
bonus action, select up to five allies within 60m. They can use their reactions to immediately take actions.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.


### Juggernaut

Juggernauts are living tanks and nearly impossible to take down. Their tech armor upgrades make sure they can take a hit, or one hundred, without so much as a scratch.

#### Assault Armor

Starting at 3rd level, your Tech Armor is rigged for keeping the action on you. When
you activate tech armor, you project a distracting holographic image (your choice) and each hostile creature within 20m
that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting modifier). On a failure,
a creature is compelled to attack you while your Tech Armor is active. A creature that is compelled to attack you always 
targets you when it makes a weapon or spell attack.

Each time a creature that is compelled to attack you takes damage from a source other than you, it makes a new Wisdom saving 
throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is no longer compelled to attack you and is immune to
Assault Armor for the next 24 hours.

Synthetic creatures have advantage on the Wisdom saving throw.


#### Hardened Tech Armor

At 7th level, you're able to shrug off hits that would normally devastate others. While your tech armor
is active, you have +1 AC and any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

```
```

#### Advanced Tech Armor

Starting at 10th level, your tech armor benefits from the energy used to cast biotic and tech powers. Whenever you
cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, your tech armor gains 10 hit points. When you cast a cantrip, you tech armor gains 3 hit points.


#### Unyielding Assault

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen.
While tech armor is active, you are immune to becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen.


#### Adaptive Tech Armor

At 18th level, when your tech armor takes damage, it gains resistance to that damage type. If more than one
type of damage happens simultaneously, tech armor gains resistance to both.

  style='width:325px; margin-top: -60px' />

### Guardian

Guardians support and buff party members by utilizing different AI packages from their Tech Armor ability and protecting them with their Omni-Shield. They're also one of the most skilled classes, gaining the Expertise feature twice.

#### Expertise

At 3rd level, and again at 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either 
of the chosen proficiencies.


#### Omni-Shield

Starting at 3rd level, you've mastered the omni-shield. As a bonus action, create a large kinetic shield out 
of your omni-tool that lasts one minute. You can end Omni-shield at any point as a free action.

While Omni-Shield is deployed you cannot use another omni-* melee weapon. Instead, gain the following:

* +1 AC.
* If a creature within 2m of you is attacked, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack.
* As an attack action, you may make a melee attack roll. On a hit, deal 1d12 bludgeoning damage. You may shove a
hit creature backward 2m.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.


#### Tech Aura

In addition to the standard defensive VI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different VI packages. 
At 7th level, when you activate
tech armor, you can choose to run a different VI package instead. When you activate an alternate package, you
do not gain hit points, instead, you and any friendly creature within 10m of you gain
the effect of the package for 1 hour. You may only have one tech armor active at once.

At 14th level, if you have no remaining uses of Tech Armor, you can expend a spell slot to activate it.

At 18th level, increase the distance of your Tech Aura packages to 20m.

__Defensive,__ This is the standard Tech Armor package. It does not affect allies.

__Anti-biotic.__ Resistance to force and necrotic damage.

__Anti-tech.__ Resistance to fire and cold damage.

__Grounded.__ Resistance to lightning damage.

__Reactive.__ Add your spellcasting modifier to Strength or Dexterity saving throws.

__Speed.__ Increase speed by 6m. Can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.

__Regen.__ Regenerate shield points equal to your spellcasting modifier on the start of each of your turns.

__Inspiring Music.__ Advantage on saving throws against becoming frightened or charmed.

__Brute force.__ Creatures within your aura deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage with melee attacks.

__Negation Field.__ Creatures within your aura can't be primed.

#### Sculpt Spells

Starting at 10th, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your spells. When you cast a spell that
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half 
damage on a successful save.

#### Omni-Shield

Starting at 14th level, you can transform your omni-shield into a fire shield or cryo shield.

__Fire Shield__. Gain all the benefits of Omni-Shield. In addition, a target hit by a Fire Shield attack takes 3d10 fire damage. 
This damage detonates primed targets, but you are immune to any detonating effects.

__Cryo Shield__. Gain all the benefits of Omni-Shield. In addition, a target hit by a Cryo Shield attack takes 1d8 cold 
damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or become <condition id="frozen"/> until the end its next turn.
