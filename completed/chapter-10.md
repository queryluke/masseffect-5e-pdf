# Chapter 10: Vehicles
Unlike in traditional 5e fantasy settings, in the Mass Effect universe, players and GMs can expect to be both
frequently and actively involved in the operation of modes of transportation beyond animal mounts, wagons, and
sailing ships. This module is intended to be a “bolt-on” set of rules to use in ME5e campaigns where significant
playtime is dedicated to the use of vehicles, both for travel and combat. If your campaign only uses
vehicles as a narrative bridge or as “set dressing” you do not need to include these rules in your game.

## Transports & Starships
All vehicles are broadly categorized as either a transport or a starship. A __transport__ can be any of a wide range of
vehicles from a single-person ATV or motorbike to an armored personnel carrier to a small shuttle or orbital star-fighter.
__Starship__ refers to (typically larger) vessels designed to travel in deep space between planets. A general
rule-of-thumb is that if a vehicle can travel from one world to another, either by means of an FTL drive or a mass
effect relay, it is a Starship. Otherwise, it’s probably a transport.

<v-alert type="info" :value="true">
A notable exception is the UT-47 Kodiak drop shuttle featured through the Mass Effect series. This vehicle, and others
like it, can be considered both a “transport” and a “starship”, depending on the context.
</v-alert>

## Vehicle Stats
All vehicles share some of the same basic features.

___Armor Class___. AC for vehicles works exactly the same as in the basic 5e rules. See the _Damage and Healing_ section in chapter 9

___Hull Points___. Also known as hit points. This represents how much damage a vehicle or starship can take before it is destroyed.

___Shield Points___. Shields for vehicles and starships work generally the same as describe in the _Shield Points_ section
of chapter 9, with a notable exception: Vehicle shields can only be regenerated in combat when players attempt the
Restore action (explained later in this chapter).


___Speed___. For vehicles, speed is relative to other vehicles and is represented as a static number not as meters. For
the purposes of combat, it represents the number of playmat spaces the vehicle can move on its turn when moving
at a normal pace.

___Range___. Range represents how far the vehicle can travel in one 24 period. For starships, range is used in conjunction with the Galaxy Map. Each line indicates the travel time between star systems, which you subtract from the starships range.
Travel to planets within a star systems costs 1 range. You can read more about range for starships in the
_Traveling the Galaxy_ section later in this chapter.

___Minimum Crew___. The number of crew required for the vehicle to operate. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, it may be possible to operate a vehicle with less than the minimum required number of crew. Rolls made to operate vehicles in these conditions will most likely be made at disadvantage, again at the GM’s discretion.

___Crew Capacity___. The total number of sentient organisms that a ship can accommodate. This is a combination of active crew and any passengers.
In some cases, this number can be expanded by using cargo capacity, below.

___Cargo Capacity___. How much “stuff” a vehicle can hold. This is measured in Megagrams (also known as a “tonne” or “metric ton”).

_1 Mg = 1,000 kg = 2,204 lbs._

This will be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg (500 kg). When calculating cargo
capacity, we suggest using this as a guideline to estimate cargo capacity rather than getting bogged down in specific
calculations. For points of reference, a small hatchback car weighs just over 1 Mg while the largest tanker ships
in the world have a capacity of over 200,000 Mg.

__Systems__. Systems refer to a number of semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of a vehicle. These are
things like navigation, communications, weapons array, etc. These are used to simulate the cooperative effort involved
in operating larger, complex vessels, and player characters will often be called upon to make skill-based rolls to
operate these individual systems. Generally speaking, small vehicles, especially those with only a single crew member,
will not have designated systems.

___Weapons___. In many cases, weapons will refer to a specific system or systems on a vehicle. Vehicle-mounted weapons will
typically have a multiplier after their damage roll to represent how powerful they are. For example, a cruiser’s mass
accelerator cannon has a damage roll of 2d6[x100] and an M35 Mako’s coaxial machine-gun has a damage roll of 2d6[x10].
In these situations, you roll and add damage dice and any bonuses as usual. After you have determined your result,
multiply the total by the amount indicated. In our example, if both weapons roll a __7__ for their damage, the cruiser
deals __700__ damage and the Mako deals __70__.

___Size___. Most transports use the standard size categories: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. However,
starships can become truly colossal and have 4 additional categories.

___Cost___. The costs listed for vehicles represent their market value. Some vehicles, instead, are __military__ meaning the vehicles
cannot be purchased on the open market. Instead, characters will need inside connects, the black market, or luck
to acquire these vehicles.

__*Challenge Rating (CR)*__. Transports have a CR between 0 and 30, which is based on its hp, ac, and damage. Starships have a __+__ symbol after their CR, which indicates that this CR is a relative representation based on other starships. It is unlikely that operatives will destroy a starship with traditional weapons. Instead, they'll likely have to use other vehicles. For example, a starship with a CR of __12+__ has the same XP reward as a level CR creature when the operatives destroy it
using other vehicles. If operatives did manage to destroy the vehicle using traditional means, we recommend providing XP equal to the standard amount multiplied by 10. For example, a cr 12 creature provides 8,400 XP. If players destroyed this with traditional means, the GM can reward 84,000 XP.

<br>
___
>##### Starship Sizes
>
>__Frigates__ are light transport vehicles, usually used for exploration, transportation of small squads, privately
funded excursions, or stealth transport. The Normandy is an example of a frigate. Frigates can land on planets and
typically host a crew of 5-20.
>
>__Cruisers__ are middleweight ships that can either transport large amounts of supplies from place to place or focus on
firepower. Military cruisers tend to be the front-line of the battle and have powerful weapons, shields, and armor.
Cruisers typically have crews of 20 - 100 and are able to land on planets.
>
>__Carriers__, also called _freighters_,
are large ships meant to carry transports (starfighters and dropships). Carriers are primarily military
in nature though some venture capitalists have used carriers for mining operations and colonizing efforts. Carriers are
typically weak in combat, being slow and lacking much firepower or shielding. Instead, carriers utilize their transports
for offense and defense. Carriers are built in space and are too large to land on planets (purposefully). Instead, most
carriers use drop ships for planetary exploration. Carriers can support crews in the hundreds.
>
>__Dreadnoughts__ are the largest class of ship, generally a kilometer or more long with incredible firepower that’s
harnessed in the main cannon which is able to decimate entire cities, squads of enemy fighters, and other dreadnoughts. Dreadnoughts
are meant for extended life in space, usually hosting a crew in the thousands and a self-sustaining ecosystem of shops,
leisure activities, police force, politics, etc. Think of dreadnaughts as a small town floating through space. The arks
of Andromeda were dreadnoughts as are the Liveships that the quarian race inhabits. The ships are so costly to make
that the total number of dreadnoughts in the Milky Way is less than 200 with most races having only one or none. It’s
impossible to land Dreadnoughts on planets safely.

```
```

## Systems
Systems are the semi-independent functions that make-up the overall operation of the vehicle. But systems also refer
or a "place" within the vehicle where crucial operations must be performed. For example, to pilot the vehicle,
you typically have to be at the helm, and to fire the weapons, you have to be at the terminal that controls the cannons
or targeting system. In some cases, a vehicle might have a __combined system__, e.g. _Helm/Navigation/SSC_. When two
or more systems are combined, operatives can access their functions from a single (or sometimes multiple) locations.

___Helm___.
The helm is the pilot seat. Players at the helm are able to take the Maneuver action, which can temporarily increase the
AC of their starship or vehicle, representing the pilot’s ability to evade oncoming attacks.

___Navigation___.
A starships navigation system is necessary to plot jumps between Mass Effect Relays. More about using your ships
navigation can be found in the Travelling the Galaxy section below.

___Weapons___.
Players must be at the weapons system to take the Attack action in combat. Weapon damage for vehicles has a x10 modifier.
Starships have a x100 modifier.

___EWS (Electronic Warfare Suite).___
The ships EWS protects the vehicle from hacking attempts but also allows the crew to attempt to hack other ships.
Players must be at the EWS system to take the Harden or Sabotage action in combat.

___SSC (Sensors, Scanners, and Communications)___.
Every vehicle comes with at least some modicum of sensors, scanners, and communication systems. Sensors and scanners
allow players to scan planets and satellites for composites and valuable materials. Comms allow the vehicle to hail
other ships and planets. Players must be at the Sensors systems to take the Scan action during combat.

___Drive___.
The drive and engineering deck are the heart of the ship. Damage to a ship’s drive can render it immobile and shut down
other vital systems. Players at the Engineering system can attempt the Restore action in combat.

### Additional Systems & Upgrades
Starships can have additional systems on board, such as improved quarters, workshops, and labs. Starship systems
can also be upgraded. The Ship Upgrades table provides a list of common systems and system upgrades.

Some systems provide a list of Downtime Activities, meaning players can participate in one of the Downtime Activity
listed while on board the ship during a long rest. The Downtime Training has a list of tool and/or weapon proficiencies
that can be learned from participating in the _Downtime Activity_ section of chapter 8.

Adding a new system or installing an upgrade takes 8 hours of uninterrupted work. You can either pay a skilled
hireling for a days work or you can make the upgrades yourself.

### Maintaining Systems
Every system requires maintenance, and vehicle systems are no different. For larger vehicles, like starships,
your maintenance is generally performed by your __crew__. Every system requires at least 16 hours of maintenance per month.
Maintenance can be performed by a skilled hireling for 3000 credits over 2 long rests, or over time by a dedicated crew
member (as discussed below).

#### Replacing systems
If a system breaks and must be replaced, you lose any benefits that system provides until your replace it. Relacing a broken system costs 300,000 or the price of the system in the ship upgrades table, whichever is lower.

##### Months without Maintenance
<div style='width:60px'>Months</div> | Effect
:---:|:---|
1|Any checks made at the system are made at disadvantage and any downtime activities completed with the system take twice as long.
2|Roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the system breaks and cannot be used in any way. It must be replaced.
3|Roll a d20. On a 10 or less, the system breaks and cannot be used in any way. It must be replaced.
4|Roll a d20. On a 15 or less, the system breaks and cannot be used in any way. It must be replaced.
5|The system breaks and cannot be used in any way. It must be replaced.

## Crew

All starships require some amount of crew to remain functional and the more systems your ship has the more crew it will
need. The __minimum crew__ attribute of your ship indicates the number of people you need to operate and maintain the
ship. Every minimum crew member is linked to at least 1 starship system.

#### Roleplaying Crew
You can treat crew as NPCs or as an abstract number. Though we highly suggest the former. Crew do not require a stat
block; a name, description, and alignment are generally enough.

#### Operatives as Crew
Characters may instead choose to take the role of a crew member and perform the duties that a hired NPC would do. However,
to do this requires the character to spend their free time performing the duties that the crew member would have done.
The character must also be proficient in the system they want to maintain. Special systems (like the rec room or med-bay)
do not require a proficiency and __combined systems__ only require to be proficient in one of the systems that are combined.

An operative that chooses to take on the role of a crew member must spend at least 1 long rest per month maintaining the system.

```
```

### Paying Crew
Your crew expects to live a modest lifestyle. The owner(s) of the ship must pay each crew member 150 credits per day. At the
end of each month, multiply your required crew by 150 and again by 30. If you cannot pay the total amount, you either
pay none of it (at which point all members crew become disgruntled) or you pay all of it and roll a d6. The result is the
number of crew that become disgruntled.

### Disgruntled Crew
Disgruntled crew cause problems. They get in fights, slack off, leave for better jobs, and may even mutiny! When you
start a long rest on board your ship, if you have at least 1 disgruntled crew member, roll a d20, add the number of
disgruntled crew on board to the roll. Then consult the Disgruntled Crew table.

##### Disgruntled Crew
<div style='width:70px'>d20 + crew</div> | Effect
:---:|:---
1 - 5|Nothing happens.
6 - 8|A fight breaks out between two crew members. Another member of your crew becomes disgruntled.
9 - 11|One of your disgruntled crew quits the next time you’re at port.
12 - 13|A crew member starts an private email chain that infuriates the other crew. Two additional crew become disgruntled.
14 - 15|All of your disgruntled crew quit the next time you’re at port.
16 - 17|A crew member forgets to service their system. You must pay 3,000 credits before you can use it again. (If this is the Drive, you ship cannot move between systems)
18 - 19|A crew member sabotages their system. You must pay 20,000 credits before you can use it again. (If this is the Drive, you ship cannot move between systems)
20 +|The crew mutinies. They all become hostile and attack your party.

#### Extended Space Travel
Living on a starship for an extended period of time is difficult and can aggravate even the most experienced space
travelers. For every week you spend traveling the galaxy, you must spend one long rest at port. The port must be at a
settled world in a town or city.

Failure to spend a long rest at port can potentially cause your crew to become disgruntled. Every time you skip a day at
port, roll a d6. The result is the number of crew that become disgruntled.



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 4 | VEHICLES</div>

\page

#### Dealing with disgruntled crew
You reduce the number of disgruntled crew in the following ways:

- Fire the disgruntled crew member. You will need to find a replacement for that crew member's system. At the GM's
  discretion, this may also cause more crew to become disgruntled.
- Throw the crew member out an airlock. You will need to find a replacement for that crew member's system. In
  addition, roll a d6. The result is the number of additional crew that become disgruntled due to your actions. _Note:
  advisable when a majority of the crew is disgruntled. Best practices suggest throwing the entire crew out the airlock
  in these situations and hiring entirely new crew at a port_.
- Provide bonus pay equal to one week's salary (1,050 credits)
- Provide an extended stay at a port (2 long rests worth)

If your group has created NPCs for each of your crew, the GM might add new ways for the crew to become disgruntled. If
you ignore a distress signal, a good crew member might become disgruntled. Of if you hand over a large cache to the
authorities, a chaotic or evil crew member might become disgruntled. Additionally, the GM can adjudicate other creative
ways to make disgruntled crew contented again. Some may like music, some games and your characters can roleplay situations
that result in a pleased crew member.

## Starship Combat
Vehicle combat works similarly to standard creature combat. Each player rolls initiative as normal. Each enemy vehicle
also rolls initiative, with any NPCs on board those vehicles acting on the vehicles initiative count. Vehicles do not
add any bonus to their initiative rolls. You may use the vehicles’ speed to break ties between vehicle rolls.

### Starship Actions
The primary difference in starship combat is that operatives on board a starship have an additional list of actions
they can make on their turn. Most actions require the player to be stationed at the necessary __system__. When an
encounter begins, operatives may choose to “Report to battle stations” and place themselves at a specific system.


#### Attack - Weapon System
Make a ranged attack roll. Do not add your proficiency bonus unless you are proficient with Starship Systems (Weapons).

#### Targeted Attack - Weapon System
Name a system on a target vehicle and make a ranged attack roll. The target’s AC has a +5 bonus against this attack. On
a hit, roll damage and the system is __disabled__ and cannot be used until it is __repaired__. Any creature manning that
system takes damage equal to one half the damage roll.

#### Maneuver - Helm
Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check.  On a success, your ship’s AC increases by an amount equal to half
its speed score until the start of your next turn.

```
```

#### Hard Maneuver - Helm
Make a DC 20 Dexterity (Vehicle Handling) check. On a success, your ship’s AC increases by an amount equal to twice its
speed score until the start of your next turn. Creatures on board your ship must make a Constitution saving throw to
endure to heavy g-forces imposed on the ship. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on its next action. Creatures
on board your ship cannot take the Move action until the start of your next turn.

#### Repair - Anywhere
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you patch some damage done to your ship, restoring
50 hit points.

#### Advanced Repair - Anywhere
Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you manage to repair major damage, restoring 150 hit points.

#### System Repair - Disabled System
To take this action, you must be located at a system that is __disabled__. Make a DC 20 Intelligence (Engineering) check.
On a success, the system is repaired and can be used again.

#### Restore - Drive
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check. On a success, you’re able to reroute power to your shields, restoring 100
shield points.

#### Harden - EWS
Make a DC 10 Intelligence (Electronics) check. On a success, you harden the security of your EWS until the start of
your next turn. While hardened, any attempt to sabotage your ship will have disadvantage.

#### Sabotage - EWS
Choose a target from the table below and make an Intelligence (Electronics) check. The DC of this check and its effect
on a success is determined by the chosen target. You must choose your target before making your Intelligence check.

<div class="markdown-content">

Target | <div style='width:30px'>DC</div> | Effect
--- | :---: | ---
SSC | 10 | Target cannot take the Scan action until the start of your next turn.
Helm | 12 | Target has disadvantage on Maneuver and Hard Maneuver checks until the start of your next turn.
Shields | 15 | Reduce the targets shields by 1d4 (x50)
Navigation | 18 | The target ship cannot Flee.
Weapons | 20 | Target has disadvantage on Attack and Targeted attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

</div>

<br>

#### Scan - SSC
Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check as your peruse the logs of incoming ship data. On a success, you may
ask one question about a target ship. The GM must answer this question honestly.




<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 4 | VEHICLES</div>

\page

#### Flee - Navigation
Make a DC 14 Intelligence (Science) check to plot a course away from battle. On a success, you may enter FTL and flee
the battle. Combat immediately ends and you move to a system within your ship’s range.

#### Move - Anywhere
Use your Action to move to a different Starship System.

#### Help - Anywhere
Use your Action to Help a friendly creature use a Starship System. You must be located at the same system as the
creature. The creature gains advantage the next time it takes an action with the starship system.

#### Defer to VI - Anywhere
Use your Action to defer to the ship’s onboard VI. You may have it take any of the Starship System actions. When you do
so, roll a d20 to make the check or attack. You cannot add any modifiers or bonuses to the roll.


## Travel
The primary benefit of starships is their ability to travel around the galaxy. A galaxy map can be found on the next page which can be used in reference to these rules. For campaigns set in the Andromeda Galaxy, you can use the rules but will need to find your own map.

### The Milky Way
The Milky Way comprises a number of __Clusters__ (represented by the yellow, target icons <v-icon>filter_center_focus</v-icon> on the map).
Each Cluster is composed of __Systems__, and, in turn, each System contains a group of planetary objects (generally a
star and any number of planets and their moons, planetoids, asteroids, comets and other celestial bodies).

For example, Earth is a planet in the Sol System, which is the only system in the Local Cluster. Tuchanka (the homeworld 
of the Krogan) is part of the Aralakh System, which is one of 3 systems in the Krogan DMZ cluster.

> ##### Names of Celestial Bodies
You may wonder why the names aren’t more “alien”. Our best guess is that the names are either part 
of a human-centered database (in which names were provided to the entries by humans), or that the names have been 
translated into similar human-cultured counterparts. For example, the Athena Nebula is home of the Asari, a race of 
androgynous beings that associate themselves to a female gender. Thus the nebula’s name (in Asari) might be a cultural 
figure, turn-of-phase, or mystical entity that is best represented as Athena in human culture.

```
```
#### Space Transports
There four types of transports in the game: land, water, air, and space. To leave a planet or move between planets in a 
system requires a space transport. For simplicity's sake, travel within a system (from any celestial body to 
another) takes less than 24 hours. Using the Sol system as an example, a party could leave Earth and arrive at Io, 
Europa, Pluto, or Sol’s Mass Relay within 24 hours. The GM can adjust this time as they see fit. A rickety ship 
might move more slowly and require many stops at moons and planets along the way. A very fast ship might make the 
journey from Earth to Pluto within a few hours.

#### Leaving a planet
The time it takes to leave a planet varies widely based on how regulated space traffic is on that planet. On urban worlds
like Thessia or the Citadel, it can take as long as 2-4 hours to orbit and dock. On uninhabited worlds, your ship can 
land and leave as quickly as the pilot is capable. This can take as little as a few minutes. Finding a safe place to 
land might take a little longer.

#### Starships
To travel from system to system, or cluster to cluster, your party will need to use a starship. Every 
starship has a __range__ attribute which represents the number of system and cluster jumps it can make in a 24 
hour period. Traveling between systems in a cluster or jumping from one cluster to another takes 1 range.

Traveling between systems is the same as traveling between planets. You can move to any other system within a cluster
and it costs 1 range. A starship with 3 range that starts on Tuchanka can leave the planet an arrive in
Nith (another system in the Krogan DMZ cluster) within 24 hours. The same starship (with a range of 3) could also leave
Turchanka, fly to the Nith system, then to the Dranek system (also in the Krogan DMZ cluster), and back to the
Aralakh system within a 24 hour period. If the ship was making stops on planets in each system, it would likely take
longer as the ship enters and leaves orbit.

Traveling between clusters requires a __Mass Relay__. Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered throughout the
Milky Way, forming an enormous network that allows interstellar travel. There is only one Mass Relay per cluster, located
in a single system which is marked with a * on the map. To travel from cluster to cluster, you must first travel to
the system that contains the mass effect relay. Then you can jump to another cluster.

Mass Relays are connected as a network, but travel between relays might require additional jumps. I.e., unlike travel
between planets and systems, you can only move between clusters following the lines on the map.

##### Example Travel
The party has been searching for a Prothean device in the Carbonaceous Asteroid (_Phoenix system, Argos Rho cluster_).
To collect their reward, they must return the device to a fence on the Citadel.

In this example, the party has requisitioned a starship with a range of 2. It takes 1 range to move from the
Phoenix system to the Hydra system which contains the Mass Relay for the Argos Rho cluster. Then it requires 2 Mass
Relay jumps (Argos Rho > Horse Head Nebula > Serpent Nebula), arriving in the Widow system where the Citadel is located.
For our group, this would take as little as 24 but no more than 48 hours to complete the journey.

## Variant Rules
In addition to the above rules, you can add the following variant rules into your campaign to increase the flavor from the Mass Effect video games.

### Variant: Navigation

As a GM, you can choose whether or not exploration & navigation are an essential component. If not, you can assume that
every ship has a full list of star maps and travel from cluster to cluster and system to system is as easy as punching
in coordinates.

However, if you'd like to provide more of a challenge, you can have your players use the Navigation starship system to
navigate the galaxy. With this rule, have your players make an Intelligence (Science) check before any planned travel,
representing the plotting of a course. The DC of this roll is either 12 (for known locations) or 18 (for unknown).
On a success, the characters arrive at the location as normal, but it takes twice as much time and fuel on a failure.
You can also impose other consequences such as pirates, disgruntled crew, or ship damage.

Whether or not the characters know of a location is dependent on __Star Maps__. You may choose to break up star maps
by Sectors (the large groupings of clusters) or by clusters.

### Variant: Mining & Probes
Ships can be equipped with Mining Probes. Each probe costs 100 credits and ships have a capacity based on its size:
10 for frigates, 20 for carriers, 50 for cruisers, and 100 for dreadnoughts. When orbiting a celestial body,
an operative can use the ship's SSC system to expend a Mining Probe and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The
DC of this check is determined by how "rich" the planet is.

On a success, you can spend a long rest mining the area. Roll a die based on how rich the planet is, and gain that many
units of the element.

##### Elements

Rarity | Elements | Credits / Unit
:--- | :--- | :---:
Common | Aluminium, Beryllium, Copper, Graphite, Iron, Magnesium, Silicon | 100
Uncommon | Cadmium, Fluorite, Iridium, Lithium, Nickel, Uranium | 250
Rare | Palladium, Platinum, Titanium, Vanadium | 500
Very Rare | Element Zero | 1500

##### Mining Results

Richness | Result Dice
:--- |  :---:
Scarce | d4
Poor |  d6
Moderate | d8
Abundant | d10
Rich | d12

```
```
### Variant: Fuel
Fuel in Mass Effect 5e is an abstract concept. Most ships can mine and create fuel using on-board fabricators as it travels
the Galaxy. Fuel is represented by the __range__ of the ship (how far it can travel in 24 hours). If you would like to keep track
of fuel, the GM can use the following Variant: Fuel rules.

Your "tank" capacity is equal to your ship's range multiplied by 3. Each time you expend 1 range, you also expend 1 charge from your
tank. You can either spend a long rest on an asteroid or planet mining fuel or you can refuel at a spaceport. To mine
fuel use the Variant: Mining rules above. On a success, roll a d8 and regain that many charges.

Alternatively, you can pay to refuel at a spaceport. The average rate is 1,000 credits per charge in your tank, but this
might increase or decrease based on the port.

## Creating Vehicles

The vehicle list that follows provides examples for you to use in your campaign. However, it is
encouraged that you and/or your GM create vehicles of your. Use the following guidelines
when creating your vehicle.

### Create a concept
First, you'll want to create a concept for your vehicle. What is its main purpose (defense, offense, transport, smuggling, etc)?
What race(s) are associated with the vehicle? Is it unique or mass produced? What does it look like? What size is it?

If you're looking for inspiration, check out <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/euderion/gallery/40849119/MASS-EFFECT" target="_blank">Euderion's vehicle creations on DeviantArt</a>.

### Name
Next, you'll need a good name for your vehicle. Mass produced vehicles typically have some sort of manufacturing number
combined with a codename or nickname. If your vehicle is a unique creation, it might have a symbolic name.

### Vehicle Type
The vehicle type should be either __transport__ or __starship__. If you've selected transport, designate which
transport type it is: __land__, __sea__, __air__, or __space__. Some transports can have multiple types.

### Size
If you're creating a transport, choose the size from standard sizes: Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan. For starships,
choose one of Frigate, Cruiser, Carrier, or Dreadnought.

### Speed
A vehicles speed is somewhat abstract. Mechanically, it represents the number of playmat spaces it can move in one turn.
This assumes the vehicle is moving an average pace and slow enough to turn and maneuver. Speed should range from 1 to 15.

### Range
For transports, range is the number of kilometers the vehicle can travel within 24 hours. This calculation should also
take its battery or fuel capacity into account.

For starships, the range is calculated as ftlu (faster than light units). Essentially how many Mass Effect Relay jumps
or system to system travel it can complete in 24 hours.

### Cargo
How many tonnes can the ship carry? Try thinking about how many mid-size cars can fit into the vehicle or the vehicle tow,
this is its Cargo capacity.

### Cost
What is the market rate of the vehicle? It might be that the vehicle is military and not sold on the open market.

### AC
How durable is your vehicle's armor? Or how difficult is it to hit? ACs for vehicles generally range from 10 - 25.

### HP & SP
Use the following table to find the average hull points and shield points. You should adjust the average based on the
concept of your vehicle. Was it made for defense? Add more HP. Does it has a state-of-the-art drive, add more SP.

##### Vehicle Hit Points / Shield Points

Type | HP | SP
:--- | :---: | :---:
Transport | 150 | 50
Frigate | 1200 | 250
Cruiser | 2000 | 500
Carrier | 3500 | 750
Dreadnought | 6000 | 1500


### Systems
Next, you'll want to decide how many systems your vehicle has. You can either make combined systems (for smaller vehicles)
or have individual systems (for large starships). A system might be so advanced that it requires multiple crew member to
maintain.

### Crew
Each vehicle has a minimum and maximum crew.

#### Minimum
To find the minimum crew, add the number of crew needed for each of the systems.

#### Maximum
The maximum crew is generally based on the size of the vehicle

```
```
##### Maximum Vehicle Crew
Type | Max Crew
:--- | :---:
Medium | 1
Large | 2-3
Huge | 6-8
Gargantuan | 10-20
Frigate | 20-30
Cruiser | 30-100
Carrier | 100-1000
Dreadnought | 1000+

### Weapons

Decide what weapons are equipped on the vehicle. For transports, damage rolls are multiplied by 10 and by 100 for
starships. It's also ok for the vehicle to have no weapons.

### Challenge Rating

To calculate the CR, you'll need access to the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table in the Dungeon Master's
Guide, pg. 274.

#### Offensive CR
First, find the offensive CR by calculating the average of all the damaging attacks. If this is a starship, additionally
divide the average by 10. Then find the CR associated with that damage on the Monster Stats table.

#### Defensive CR
Next, find the defensive CR by adding the hull point and shield points together. If this is a starship, additionally,
divide the sum by 10. Then find the CR associated with that hit point value on the Monster Stats table. If the AC
is greater than the AC on the Monster Stats table, increase the defensive CR by 1 for every 2 points above the target AC.

#### Final CR
The final CR is the average of the offensive and defensive CR, rounded up. If this is for a starship, notate a __+__ symbol
beside the CR.

> ##### CR Calculation
>__Starship__, AC: 25, HP: 2500, SP: 600, Attack: 1100 & 900
>
>- __Offensive CR = ((1100 + 900) / 2) / 10 = 100__, corresponds with a CR of 16
>- __Defensive CR = (2500 + 600) / 10 = 310__, corresponds with a CR of 16. However, the target AC for CR 16 is only 18. So the final Defensive
CR becomes 19 (+3 because the AC is 25).
>
> __Final CR = (16 + 19) / 2 = 17.5 = 18+__
