# Appendix F: Omni-tool Programs
Most omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator designs. However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general population's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs that have been scrubbed from the exonet.

Read the _Omni-tool Programs_ section of Chapter 5 for more information.

## Omni-tool Programs List
The Omni-tool Programs are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Active_Camo.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

The user's omni-tool diverts energy to coat their armor in color-adaptive hard light, using
data obtained from the suit's micro-sensors. While not making the wearer truly invisible, this adaptive camouflage helps
the user blend into any environment. Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage and you have
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. You can use an action toggle this effect off or on as a free action.





#### All_Terrain.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

You can spend a free action to flash forge hard light enhancements for your armor, such as climbing spikes
on your boots and gloves, and flexible fins on your boots. While running this program, climbing and swimming don't cost
you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.





#### Cardio_Muscular_Optimizer.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

A program that syncs up with the user's VI to run a full-body performance optimizer. Your Constitution score is 19 while
you are running this program. It has no effect if your Constitution score is already 19 or higher.





#### Cognition_Booster.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

This program diverts positive energy from your omni-tool to the nerve clusters in your brain, accelerating your thought
processes and critical thinking. Your Intelligence score becomes 19 while this program is active. If your Intelligence
is equal to or higher than 19, this program has no effect.


```
```


#### Deflector_Array.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

Developed by technicians who wanted more protection while maintaining light armor, while this program is Active your
omni-tool generates a form-fitting nano-cloud of hard light atoms around you, invisible to the naked eye. This increases
the chances that an incoming bullet or attack will be turned aside by the nano-cloud, acting as an extra layer of protection.

The user gains +2 to AC while not wearing Medium or Heavy Armor, or using a Riot Shield. (Anything bulkier than Light
Armor throws off the cloud's bio-tracking, and renders it ineffective.)





#### Distortion_Veil.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

While this program is active, highly-synced, micro-holo projectors blur the user's visual image and electromagnetic
presence on non-IFF'd sensors. This causes attack rolls against the user to have disadvantage. If the user takes damage,
this property ceases to function until the start of their next turn (due to the projectors re-routing power and re-compensating).
This property is suppressed while the user is incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.





#### Double_Time.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

While this program is Active, you can use a bonus action to re-route a third of your omni-tool's processing power to
your armor's mobility servos, dramatically increasing your speed. You double your walking speed, and any attack of
opportunity made against you is made at disadvantage. This effect lasts 10 minutes, and can only be activated once per
long rest.

(this re-route wasn't intended by any armor manufacturer, the recovery time allows the omni-tool to scan and repair
the abuse electronics within the armor.)





#### EM_Trail_Scrambler.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

As an action, activate an ionized laser that targets the environment behind you. This makes attempts to track the user
via traditional or electromagnetic signal tracing harder, and Survival/Science checks made to do so are made at
disadvantage. One installation of this program lasts for 1 hour.

#### Experimental_Barrier_Generator.exe
*Rare program*

Convert 10 omni-gel into 1d4+4 black beads that measure 2 centimeters in diameter but weigh nothing. These beads are held
in place on the user's wrist by the omni-tool's hard light field.

As an action, you can launch a bead at a target location within 30m. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each
creature within a 6m radius of where the bead landed must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage.
A sphere of transparent biotic energy then encloses that area for 1 minute. Any creature that fails its save and is
completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded their saves or are partially within
the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it.

Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect penetrate it.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's
walking speed.

The sphere can be picked up, and its altered mass causes it to weigh only half a kilogram (~ 1lb). regardless of the
weight of creatures inside.

__Single-use__: Once you use this program, it deletes itself from your omni-tool.





#### Expert_Hand.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

Your omni-tool optimizes your gauntlets' mobility and sensitivity. Many operators and infiltrators prefer this program,
as it makes their jobs much easier. While Active, you gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and
Intelligence (Electronics) checks made to bypass locks.





#### Flash_Hypno.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

This program activates strobes in the user's visor/eyewear with 3 powerful charges. You can expend 1 charge as an
action to cast the 'Charm Person' spell (save DC 13) on an organic creature within 10m of you, provided that you and the
target can see each other. Your omni-tool regains all expended charges after a long rest, provided that the program is
Active.


```
```



#### Primal_Tap.exe
*Varies program, requires installation*

While this program is active, your omni-tool perfectly balances your adrenal, muscular, skeletal and cardio systems to
optimize physical power. Depending on what Mark program you have active, your Strength score increases to a certain amount.
This has no effect if your Strength score is already equal to or higher than that value. Many military groups equip
their combat-ready infantry with a version or Mark I or II, but more up-to-date versions of the program are incredibly
rare to find, the bleeding edge of military technology that only the best can afford.

Version | STR Score | Rarity
--- | --- | ---
Mark I | 19 | Uncommon
Mark II | 21 | Rare
Mark III | 23 | Rare
Mark IV | 26 | Spectre
Mark V | 29 | Spectre





#### Quantum_Displacer.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

Your omni-tool is equipped with a highly experimental quantum device. You can spend a bonus action and 3 omni-gel to designate
an open space within 60m, and instantly teleport there.

You project one invisibly small molecule into that space, which is quantum entangled with a molecule in your armor.
Sending an energy current through the device will re-unite the molecules instantly, effectively teleporting you to your
designated location. The device is then offline until the end of your next long rest.

#### Show_Stopper.exe
*Uncommon program*

This suite of programs contains a subset of holographic displays. A full suite has 20 displays. A used program is usually
missing 1d20 âˆ’ 1 displays.

The creator of this program, a human hacker, known as Gahri Gi'gax, wrote a randomization algorithm into its use. You can use
an action to activate a display at random from the program, spawning a holographic image within 12m of you.

The image of one or more creatures forms over the targeted area and remains until dispelled. The holographic creature
appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While
you are within 50m of the hologram and can see it, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 12m of the initial
location. Any physical interaction with the hologram reveals it to be an illusion because objects pass through it.
Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as a hologram with a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The hologram lasts 1 hour or until you cancel the display. At which point, the display removes itself from the suite.
Once you have used all of the displays, the program deletes itself from your omni-tool.

#### Spotter_Support_System.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

While this program is Active, your omni-tool links up to your armor's gauntlets, scanners, and weapon systems. Roughly
a third of its processing power is diverted into calculating micro-corrections when you fire at a target, generating
minuscule magnetic fields to align your aim more correctly. You are considered proficient with Sniper Rifles while this
program is Active, and gain a +2 to damage rolls with such weapons.





#### Terra_Angelis.exe
*Spectre program, requires installation*

_Can only be used by humans_

This is an experimental, Cerberus-funded VI was created in the pursuit of a perfect AI that will put the protection of
humanity first and foremost. While it never achieved true AI status, this VI is highly advanced and single-mindedly
devoted to protecting & enabling humanity.

When you activate this program, designate one ranged weapon to install Terra Angelis onto. This weapon now has +3 to
attack and damage rolls. The first time you attack with this weapon on each of your turns, you can choose to transfer
some or all of the weapon's bonus to your AC, instead of using the bonus on any of your attacks for that turn
(i.e., add +2 to AC and +1 to attack/damage rolls). The adjusted bonuses remain until the start of your next turn,
although you must be wielding the weapon to gain the benefits.





#### Thermic_Overvent.exe
*Uncommon program*

You can use an action to spend 1 omni-gel and overheat every heat-generating element within your omni-tool, overriding
safety protocols and using the omni-gel as propellant. You create three fire rays from your outstretched hand, each
with a range of 240m. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit,
the target takes 2d6 fire damage. When you make the attacks, make them with a modifier of +5 to the attack roll. The
omni-tool then needs time to compensate and repair itself, rendering this program inoperative until the end of a long rest.

__Unstable__: When you acquire this program, it can be used 1d6 times before the code becomes too unstable to use.





#### Threat_Assessment.exe
*Rare program, requires installation*

Your omni-tool powers a specialized VI whose purpose is to detect incoming threats and identify them for the user. This
data appears as audio and visual warnings on the user's HUD and gives the user +1 to their AC and all Saving Throws.





#### Trace_Signal_Jammer.exe
*Uncommon program, requires installation*

While this program is Activated, the user is hidden from long-range sensors. You cannot be targeted by any tracking
device that functions by receiving a tracking device's signal, and targeting lasers cannot pinpoint your precise
location, giving you advantage on any saving throws against Heavy Weapons that require Targeting to fire.
