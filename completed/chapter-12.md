# Chapter 12: Spellcasting
There isn't any traditional fantasy "magic" in Mass Effect 5e but there are super-powered abilities, advanced technology, and fantastic items. Mass Effect 5e retains the word "spell" as a catch-all to describe special powers that are available to the game's classes.

## What Is a Spell?
Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore health to the injured.

### Spell Types
Mass Effect divided spells into 3 distinct categories:

#### Biotics
Biotics is the ability of some lifeforms to create mass effect fields using element zero nodules embedded in body tissues. These powers are accessed and augmented by using bio-amps. Biotic individuals can knock enemies over from a distance, lift them into the air, generate gravitational vortices to tear obstacles or enemies apart, or create protective barriers. Biotic spells are available for Adepts, Sentinels, and Vanguards.

#### Tech
Tech spells rely on the character's omni-tool: a multipurpose diagnostic and manufacturing tool as well as a computer used for a variety of civilian and battlefield tasks, such as hacking, decryption, or repair. Higher-end omni-tools are equipped by Engineers, Sentinels, and Infiltrators to make use of their tech talents and powers. When activated, an omni-tool can appear over either of a person's forearms and/or hands, and occasionally both, as an orange hologram.

#### Combat
Combat spells rely on gadgets, physical devices, special equipment or even overriding safety protocols on armor or weapons. Combat powers have no casting cost, as they are generally instantiated by some sort of gadget or device. Instead of a casting cost, combat powers recharge on a short or long rest.

### Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 5. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) lance at 1st level and the earth-shaking Storm at 4th. Cantrips - simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote - are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell. All combat powers are considered cantrips.

Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 5th level, to cast a 5th-level spell.

```
```

### Known and Prepared Spells
Biotics rely on physical mnemonics and a biotic implant to harness the power of mass effect fields. Learning the mnemonics takes years of practice. Once mastered, biotic users can learn new varieties of controlling the fields. As biotic characters progress in levels, they learn knew varieties of biotic spells or can augment the power or utility of an existing one. In any case, once a biotic user learns a spell, it is always at their disposal.

Tech powers utilize technological assistance and micro-fabricators that are built into the operative's omni-tool. Unlike biotic users, tech users can program new spells and powers into their omni-tool like loading software onto a computer. However, the mental load required to access these powers in the heat of combat takes a superior intellect. More programs cause more confusion, and without the mental training and years of practice, tech users are limited in the number of spells they can bring into combat. This limit increases as tech users level, detailed in the class's description.

#### Advancing Spells
The class progression tables indicate when a class learns a new spell. In Mass Effect 5e, characters can choose to augment a spell they've already learned rather than learning a new one. You may only have one advancement of a spell at a time.

### Spell Slots
Regardless of how many biotic spells knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the gravitational forces into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each biotic class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 4th-level spell fits only in a 4th-level slot. So when an adept casts lance, a 1st-level spell, he or she spends one 1st-level slot.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.

#### Casting at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if an operative casts lance using one of their 2nd-level slots, that lance is 2nd level.

Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as lance and first ait, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.

#### Tech Points
In Mass Effect 5e, certain classes can use tech points to cast spells. Tech points represent the internal power of the operative's omni-tool. As the operative levels, the gain more tech points, representing the time they spend modifying their omni-tool and optimizing subroutines.

When a character casts a spell with tech points, he or she expends, at minimum, one tech point per spell's level: 1 tech point for 1st-level, 2 tech points for 2nd level, etc. You can think of a tech point as a 1st-level spell slot that can be added to other tech points to create a spell slot of a higher level. The number of tech points you can spend on a spell is limited by your class's level, indicated in the class's progression table.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended tech points.


### Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has made the spell extremely efficient to cast. A cantripâ€™s spell level is 0.

#### Combat Cantrips
Combat cantrips are a special type of cantrip, that are more powerful than biotic cantrips. Combat cantrips have limitations in the number of times you can use them per short and long rest. Certain classes (infiltrators and vanguards) have the option of learning combat powers instead of cantrips, as indicated in their class descriptions.

Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If a spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.



## Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class, the type of spell,
or the spell's effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, casting time, range, and duration.
Level and load are provided for biotic and tech spells, respectively.

The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.

### Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or even longer to cast.
Combat spells can require an Attack action to cast.

>##### Casting in Armor

>armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for >spellcasting.

```
```
#### Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

#### Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response
to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Attack action
Many Combat spells have an action cost of Attack. This means you must use the Attack combat action to cast the spell. If
a spell or effect prevents you from taking the Attack action, you cannot cast the spell.

#### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than
a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your
concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot or
spend tech points. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.


### Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like lance, the target is a creature. For a spell
like havoc strike, the target is the point in space where your character lands emitting a violent shockwave.

Most spells have ranges expressed in meters. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.
Other spells, such as the fortification spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin
point of the spell's effect must be you.

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.

### Components
In Mass Effect 5e, all spells are Somatic, meaning they require some amount of gesturing. To cast any of the spell types
a caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

There are no other spell components (such as verbal or material, as in D&D).

### Duration
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or
even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

#### Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't
be dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the effect going. This is the case with many biotics.
If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long
you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

- __Casting another spell that requires concentration__. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that
requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.
- __Taking damage__. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving
throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take
damage from multiple sources, such as a bullet and an engineer's salvo, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- __Being incapacitated or killed__. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as getting sucked out of an airlock, require you
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.


### Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

#### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect
at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes
into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically
a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect
Spells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.



### Areas of Effect
Spells such as singularity and snap freeze cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube,
cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts.
The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point
of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

#### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal
to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube
You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as
the length of each side.

A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder
A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description.
The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight
lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then
shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

#### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere
You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as
a radius in meters that extends from the point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.

### Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies
the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.



### Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target.
Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll
if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.



## Primers and Detonators
Primers and Detonators add a combo-based mechanic to combat. However, they can also add an unwanted level of complexity as tracking which creatures are primed at any given moment can become cumbersome. Therefore you may forego this rule and ignore any mention of the Primed condition or detonation effects.

Some spells and attacks cause the target to become primed as indicated in its spell text. Some spells can detonate primed targets. These spells are marked so on their spell cards. When a primed target is hit with a detonating spell or attack the primed condition ends and the detonation causes an explosive effect outlined in the Primed Condition below.

There are five primed types: Force, Necrotic, Fire, Cold, or Lightning each with its own unique detonating effect.

A creature can suffer from multiple primed types simultaneously as long as each type is different. When detonated, all explosions happen at once centered on the location of the primed target. The GM decides which effects happen in which order.
