# Chapter 9: Combat

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and enemies to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a gang hideout or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Galaxy Master. The Galaxy Master controls all the nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an operative. “You” can also mean the character or npc that you control.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of bullets, energy weapons, ducking behind cover,
slinging biotic and tech spells. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A __round__
represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a __turn__. The order of
turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a
turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

> ##### Combat Step by Step
>
>1. __Determine surprise__. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
>2. __Establish positions__. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the operatives' marching
order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries ar - -how far away and in what direction.
>3. __Roll initiative__. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.
>4. __Take turns__. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
>5. __Begin the next round__. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.


### Surprise
A team of operatives sneaks up on a patrolling cerberus squad, springing from behind cargo crates to attack them. A varren
slinks in the shadows, unnoticed by the operatives until the varren attacks one of them. In these situations, one side of
the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other.
Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of
each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction
until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.


### Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to
determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each
member of the group acts at the same time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This
is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same
from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among
their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally,
the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.


### Your Turn
On your turn, you can __move__ a distance up to your speed and __take one action__. You decide whether to move first or take
your action first. Your speed - sometimes called your walking speed - is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the "Actions in Combat" section below. Many class features and
other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The "Movement and Position" section gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your
turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "Actions in Combat."

#### Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.
The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an infiltrator to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only
when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than
one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything
that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

#### Other Activity on Your Turn
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.
For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part
of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some items and other special objects always
require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an
unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a
push a large crate into a covering position.


### Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an
instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack,
described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts
another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.



## Movement & Position


In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

<br>

>##### Interacting with Objects
>Around You Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
>
>- draw *or* sheathe a weapon
>- open or close a door
>- withdraw a medi-gel from your armor
>- pick up a dropped weapon
>- take a datapad from a table
>- remove your helmet
>- stuff some food into your mouth
>- plant a banner in the ground
>- drink all the ale in a flagon
>- throw a lever or a switch
>- extinguish a small flame
>- put your ear to a door
>- kick a small stone
>- tap the floor with your weapon
>- hand an item to another character

<br>



On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your
turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking,
or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your
speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

### Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you
have a speed of 10 meters, you can move 4 meters, take your action, and then move 6 meters.

#### Moving between Attacks
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving
between those attacks. For example, a soldier who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed
of 10 meters could move 4 meters, make an attack, move 4 meters, and then attack again.

#### Using Different Speeds
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your
speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result
determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 10 and a flying speed of 20 because you're wearing a jetpack, you could fly 10 meters,
then walk 4 meters, and then leap into the air to fly 6 meters more.


### Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous
staircases - the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every meter of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra meter. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space
count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, crates, trash cans, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult
terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.


### Being Prone
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves
down. In the game, they are <condition id="prone"/>. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes
more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 10 meters, you must
spend 5 meters of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must crawl. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra meter. Crawling 1 meter in difficult
terrain, therefore, costs 3 meters of movement.






<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\page

### Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if
the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later.

### Flying Movement
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature
is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless
it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by biotics, such as by the fly spell.


### Creature Size
Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a
particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

Size | Space
:---|:---
Tiny | 1m by 1m
Small|2m by 2m
Medium|2m by 2m
Large|4m by 4m
Huge|8m by 8m
Gargantuan|10m by 10m

#### Space
A creature's space is the area in meters that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical
dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 2 meters wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a
Medium asari stands in a 2‐meter-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the asari lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number
of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 2-meter
radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around
a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround
a Gargantuan one.

```
```

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature
can squeeze through a passage that's only 2 meters wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra
meter for every meter it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls
against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.



## Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your
class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and
what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.


### Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling
with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the soldier, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.


### Cast a Spell
Spellcasters such as engineers and adepts have access to biotics or tech powers and can use them to great effect in combat.
Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours
to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,
so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.


### Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after
applying any modifiers. With a speed of 10 meters, for example, you can move up to 20 meters on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 10 meters
is reduced to 6 meters, for instance, you can move up to 12 meters this turn if you dash.


### Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. In  Mass Effect 5e,
the Disengage action can also kick off your shield regeneration, detailed later.





<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\page

### Dodge 
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack
roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.
You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

The Dodge action can also jumpstart shield regeneration.


### Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you
aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes
the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 2 meters of you. You feint, distract the
target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before
your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.


### Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for
hiding in chapter 7. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later. 

Hiding is the third possible way to jumpstart your shield regeneration.


### Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take
the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in
response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the Blue Suns grunt steps
on the conveyor belt, I'll push the button that starts it," and "If the rachni steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember
that you can take only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger
occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires
concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are
concentrating on the singularity spell and ready lance, your singularity spell end, and if you take damage before you
release lance with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

```
```

### Reload
All guns have a heat property which indicates the number of times it can be fired before the thermal clip must be exchanged.
When you take the Reload Action, you expend a Thermal Clip from your inventory and insert it into the weapon you're currently
holding, returning the weapon's heat to its maximum value.

<br>

>##### Variant: Rapid Reload
>At the start of your turn, if you are holding only a single weapon, you may use a Bonus Action to attempt a Rapid Reload.
>Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you reload the weapon you're currently holding and may continue your turn as normal.
>
>On a failure, you must take the Reload action this turn. On a critical failure, the thermal clip drops from your hand,
>your weapon is not reloaded, and you lose your Action.
>
>*Why is this a variant rule?* Although there are class features and weapon mods that allow you to reload as a bonus action,
this variant rule gives all classes a potential chance to reload as a bonus action. In turn, this increases the number of
potential rolls per combat, which can be cumbersome and distracting. It's up to the GM and players to decide if this rule
is right for their group.

<br>

### Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search,
the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.


### Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw your weapon as part of an attack.
When an object requires your action for its use (such as throwing a grenade), you take the Use an Object action.
This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.



## Making an Attack

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an
attack has a simple structure.

1. __Choose a target__. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. __Determine modifiers__. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage
against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.




<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\page

3. __Resolve the attack__. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules
that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an
attack roll, you're making an attack.


### Attack Rolls
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a
d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class
(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its
stat block.

#### Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's
proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

___Ability Modifier__. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for
a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse, thrown, or recoil property break this rule. Some spells
also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

___Proficiency Bonus___. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you
have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.

#### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes lady luck blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a
critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.


### Unseen Attackers and Targets
Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting tactical cloak, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing
the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you
targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the
target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden - -both unseen and
unheard - when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

```
```

### Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a gun or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might
shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a gun, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger
number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack
a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell,
or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 2 meters of a hostile creature who can
see you and who isn't incapacitated.


### Melee Attacks
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a
handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an omni-tool. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes
with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

Most creatures have a 2-meter reach and can thus attack targets within 2 meters of them when making a melee attack. Certain
creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 2 meters, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar
forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your
Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

#### Gun strikes
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use your ranged weapon, hitting a target with the butt of
the gun. On a hit, a gun strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with
gun strikes if you are proficient with the type of gun.

#### Opportunity Attacks
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a
strike is called an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the
opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs
right before the creature leaves your reach.




<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\page

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity
attack when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke
an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if an adept lifts you off the ground with Pull.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a
bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your
ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

#### Grappling
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.
If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least
one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics)
check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
If you succeed, you subject the target to the <condition id="grappled"/>. The condition specifies the things that end it,
and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

___Escaping a Grapple___. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics)
or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.

___Moving a Grappled Creature___. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is
halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

#### Shoving a Creature
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it
away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll,
you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
(the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 2 meters
away from you.

<br>
>##### Contests in Combat
>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This
>section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The
>GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.


## Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm.
A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of
cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and
a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### Half Cover
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks
at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature,
whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

#### Three-quarters Cover
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover
if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a doorway, a large crate, or a thick tree trunk.

#### Total Cover
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a
target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

<br>

>##### Variant: Additional Cover Rules
>#### Size
Size matters. If the target is one size larger than the creature providing cover, the target has no cover. If the target
is one size smaller than the creature providing cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
>#### High Ground
Flying enemies or creatures on high ground are able to shoot over cover depending on the type of cover provided
>#### Friendly Fire
Don't hit your friends! If the creature providing cover is friendly and the attacking creature misses, the attack has a
50% chance to hit the friendly target. Roll a die and if the result is odd the attack hits, even the attack misses both
creatures. Or you can use the friendly creature's AC to decide if the attack hits or misses.

## Damage and Healing
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword,
a well-placed bullet, or a blast of flame from an incinerate spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the
hardiest of creatures.



### Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more
hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum
down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on
a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

___Shield Points___. Creatures wearing armor also benefit from shield points described later in this chapter.


### Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any
modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.
With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier - the same modifier used for the attack roll - to the damage.
A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.
For example, when an adept casts vortex or an engineer casts flamethrower, the spell's damage is rolled once for all
creatures caught in the blast.

#### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the
attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can
roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a monomolecular blade, roll 2d10 for the damage, rather than 1d10, and then
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the infiltrator's Sneak Attack feature,
you roll those dice twice as well.

#### Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules
of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

___Acid___. The corrosive spray of a chemical and the dissolving enzymes secreted by thresher maw spit deal damage.

___Bludgeoning___. Blunt force attacks - hammers, falling, constriction, and the like - deal bludgeoning damage.

___Cold___. The painful chill from a cryo beam breath deal cold damage.

___Fire___. Many tech spells use plasma and flames to deal fire damage

___Force___. One of the primary biotic damage types. Mass effect fields that pummel, pierce, or apply pressure deal force damage.

___Lightning___. Shock damage. Any damage done by an electrical discharge or source. Deals double damage to shields.

___Necrotic___. The second biotic damage type. Necrotic damage uses dark energy and mass effect fields on a subatomic level.

___Piercing___. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including bullets and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

___Poison___. Venomous stings, poisoned blades, and the toxic gas deal poison damage.

___Psychic___. A shock to the nervous system, rather than fear or mental damage. But the latter is possible.

___Radiant___. Radiation or damage on a nuclear level, rather than divine light.

___Slashing___. Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

___Thunder___. Shockwaves and explosions. Thunder damage is primarily caused by grenades.


### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or
an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance
to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a tech aura
that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example,
if a creature has resistance to force damage as well as resistance to biotic damage, the damage of a biotic force damage
is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

### Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through experimental cloning. Rest can
restore a creature's hit points, and medical methods such as a medi-gel or first aid spell can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit
points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, an
engineer grants a sentinel 8 hit points of healing. If the sentinel has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum
of 20, the sentinel regains 6 hit points from the engineer, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points.


### Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

#### Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die
if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a solider with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack,
she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the soldier dies.

#### Falling Unconscious
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you
regain any hit points.

#### Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to
determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any
ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself.
On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any hit points or become stable.

___Rolling 1 or 20___. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20
on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

___Damage at 0 Hit Points___. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. 
If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point 
maximum, you suffer instant death.

```
```

#### Stabilizing a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be
stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.
The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable
creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

#### Monsters and Death
Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make
death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and
follow the same rules as player characters.


### Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature
to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the
instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.


### Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points;
they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the
temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character
can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive
more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a drug grants you
12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can
still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.

## Shield Points
Shield points are a special type of regenerating hit points that protect your from fast-moving projectiles and provide
advantage in certain situations against some tech and biotic powers.

<br>

>##### Codex: Kinetic Barriers
>Kinetic barriers, colloquially called "shields", provide protection against most mass accelerator weapons. Whether on
a starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same. Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect
fields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This
affords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles but still allows the user to sit down without knocking
away their chair. The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins,
or radiation.

<br>

### Shield devices
All armor chest pieces come standard with _5 shield points_ and a _regen of 5_. However, more advanced mods and armor
sets can provide additional shields. Additionally, personal shield generators are available which can provide shields
without the operative equipping armor.


### Damage
When you have shield points and take damage, the shield points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to 
your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 shield points and take 7 damage, you lose the shield points and then 
take 2 damage. Some abilities "bypass" your shield points. In these instances, you subtract damage from your
hit points leaving your shield points unchanged.

#### Melee Weapons
All damage resulting from a melee weapon attacks bypass shield points.


### Shield Regeneration
Your armor's shield points are managed by the onboard VI, which is taxed during combat as it manages other systems: your
omni-tool or biotic implant, HUD, etc. Thus, once a threat is properly neutralized, or you are able to temporarily remove
yourself from the fray, your VI can route power back into your shields for immediate regeneration.

#### Out of combat
Your shield points regenerate completely on a short or long rest or when combat has ended for at least 1 minute.

```
```

#### In combat
To attempt to regenerate your shields during combat, you must attempt to remove yourself from the chaos, meeting one of
the following conditions on your turn:

- Take the Hide action
- Take the Dodge action
- Take the Disengage action
- Have full cover at the end of your turn

Then, if you take no damage until the start of your next turn, your shields begin to regenerate and you gain shield
points equal to your armor's regen stat. You continue to gain shield points equal to your regen stat at the start of each
of your turns. If you take damage or you reach your maximum shield point capacity, the regeneration ends.

___
> ##### Shield Regeneration Example
Todd is playing human vanguard name Todd who has invested heavily in his armor's shields, giving him 20 shield points
with a regen of 10. Todd rushes into a Reaper hoard of marauders who unleash a volley of bullets at him, bringing his
shields to 4. On his turn, Todd thinks better of his actions and decides to take the Dodge action, ducking behind a crate.
>
>Some marauders lose sight of Todd, others attempt to hit him again, but are unsuccessful. At the start of Todd's turn,
he has taken no damage since the end of his last turn and his shields begin to regenerate, immediately gaining 10 shield points.
Todd now has 14 shield points total. Todd takes his turn as he normally would.
>
>An adept spots Todd and hits him with a Warp spell. This bypasses Todd's shields and deals 13 necrotic damage. But it
does not end his shield regeneration. If this damage had been from an Assault Rifle or an Incinerate spell, Todd's shield
regeneration would have ended.
>
>On Todd's next turn, he gains another 10 shield points, putting him back to his maximum capacity of 20 and the regeneration
ends.


### Lightning Damage
All shields are vulnerable to lightning damage. In the event that a lighting attack removes all shield points, the
following steps outline how to divvy up the damage:

1. Double the lightning damage done to the target.
2. Subtract the shield points from the total damage.
3. Reduce the remaining damage by half
4. Apply the new amount to the target's hit points.
