A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

___At Higher Marks.___ When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each mark above the first.





#### Cain Trip Mine

Launch a Cain Trip Mine to a point you can see within 20m. The mine affixes to a solid surface and projects

damage on a successful one.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

#### Proximity Mine

Place a proximity mine within 2m. The first creature, besides yourself, that comes within 2m of the mine
takes 1d8 thunder damage.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

___At Higher Marks.___ When you use this mine at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each mark above the first.





#### Recon Mine

Launch a recon mine to a location of your choice within 10m. It first sticks to the target location then
scans enemies within a 10m cone, relaying tactical weak points about the enemy's armor and location. After your turn ends,
any hostile that walks through the scanning cone loses 1 AC. Each creature can only be affected by this debuff once.

You may spend another action to detonate the mine. Each creature within 2m must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 thunder damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Creatures need to pass a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the mine.

To disarm the mine, a creature must pass a DC 13 Intelligence (Electronics) check. Failing the hacking check causes
the mine to explode. The creature that made the hacking check has disadvantage on its saving throw.

A successful ranged attack on the mine (AC 10) will cause it to explode. Each creature within 2m of the mine takes 2d4 thunder damage.

___At Higher Marks.___ When you use this mine at Mark II or higher, the range increases by 2m for each mark above the first





#### Smoke Grenade

Target an area within 10m. A cloud of thick smoke erupts out in a 4m radius from the target location. The
cloud's area is heavily obscured. The cloud persists for 30 seconds. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can
disperse the smoke after 1 round, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so immediately.

___At Higher Marks.___ When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the radius increases by 2m for each mark above the first.


```
```


#### Sticky Grenade

Target an area within 10m. At the beginning of your next turn, creatures within 4m of the target must make
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage or half as much damage on a
successful one.

With a sticky grenade, you may choose to make a melee weapon attack on a target creature within 2m instead or a ranged
weapon attack on a target creature within 10m instead. Add your Dexterity modifier to the attack. Do not add your
proficiency bonus to the attack unless you have the Grenadier feat. On a hit, the grenade hits and sticks to the target,
and when it explodes, the target automatically fails its saving throw. On a miss, the grenade lands in the creature's square.

___At Higher Marks.___ When you use this grenade at Mark II or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each mark above the first.
