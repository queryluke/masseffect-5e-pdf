# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
## Overview

Your first step in playing an operative in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character
is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or asari)
and a class (such as sentinel or vanguard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the universe.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of operative you want to play. You might be a courageous soldier,
a skulking infiltrator, a fervent sentinel, or a flamboyant adept. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny engineer who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. The
conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with
a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this section, the term __character sheet__ means whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a
formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.


#### Building Kaleem
Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Sam building her salarian character, Kaleem.


### 1. Choose a Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character races are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. Some races also have subraces, such as
pure-blood asari or tank-bred krogan. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

```
```

#### Building Kaleem, Step 1
Sam is sitting down to create her character. She decides that a wiley salarian fits the character she wants to play and
she knows she wants to play with tech spells available to the engineer or infiltrator class, both of which are available
classes for the salarian race. She notes all the racial traits of salarians on her character sheet, including her speed
of 10m and Medium size.


### 2. Choose a Class

Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she
possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging
in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are __class features__ — capabilities
(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of
__proficiencies__: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things
your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level

#### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining __experience points__ (XP). A
1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate
and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the
game, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the
assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your
class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level
character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).

>##### Quick Build
Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>

\page

#### Hit Points and Hit Die
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points
are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal
to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which
you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the
number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
Resting in chapter 8).

#### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>, tools
in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#tools-kits">Equipment</nuxt-link>.) Your background gives you additional skill and
tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of
these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency
bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.


#### Building Kaleem, Step 2
Sam imagines Keleem firing tech spells from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’
proficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.

As a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.
Sam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also
notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.


### 3. Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: __Strength__, __Dexterity__, __Constitution__,
__Intelligence__, __Wisdom__, and __Charisma__. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary provides a quick reference 
for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability
particularly important.

You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest
three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time
or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores
as a result of your race choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.
To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result
by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

<div style='column-count:2'>
| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | -5 |
| 2 - 3 | -4 |
| 4 - 5 | -3 |
| 6 - 7 | -2 |
| 8 - 9 | -1 |
| 10 - 11 | 0 |
| 12 - 13 | 1 |
  | 14 - 15 | 2 |

```
```

| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |

| 24 - 25 | 7 |
| 26 - 27 | 8 |
| 28 - 29 | 9 |
| 30 | 10 |
</div>


#### Building Kaleem, Step 3
Sam decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Kaleem’s abilities. Since she’s an engineer,
she puts her highest score, 15, in Intelligence. Her next-highest, 14, goes in Dexterity. Kaleem might be a charismatic,
good leader, but Sam decides she wants the salarian to be tougher and stronger than most of her kind, so she puts decent
scores in Strength and Constitution. After applying her racial benefits (increasing Kaleems’s Intelligence by 2 and her
Dexterity by 1), Kaleem’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 15 (+2),
Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 17 (+3), Wisdom 10 (0), Charisma 8 (-1).

Sam fills in Kaleem’s final hit points: 8 + her Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.

#### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
At your Galaxy Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here
allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost
table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,
before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15,
15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers
between those extremes.

##### Ability Score Point Cost

<div style='column-count:2'>
| Score | Cost |
| :---: | :---: |
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |

```
```

| Score | Cost |
| :---: | :---: |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |
</div>


### 4. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a
name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your
character’s __alignment__ (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and __ideals__. Chapter 4 also helps you identify
the things your character holds most dear, called __bonds__, and the __flaws__ that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s __background__ describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in
the Mass Effect universe. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing
to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give
you proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your
character sheet.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>
  
\page

#### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 4
Sam lets her ability scores influence the type of character Kaleem is: her high Intelligence suggests a rapid, focused
mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or
awkward social decorum.

Sam fills in some of Kaleem’s basic details: her name, her sex (female), her height and weight, and the fact that she
is missing a cranial ridge (making her unattractive being by salarian standards).

Sam picks a lawful alignment for Kaleem, as she buys into the tradition of the Blue Suns and respects their codes. Kaleem's
lack of empathy makes her neutral in her disposition for moral codes.

Sam decides that Kaleem comes from a lowly background, rummaging the slums of Omega. When she was caught stealing equipment
from the Blue Suns, the general spared her life but put her to work scrapping and repairing weapons, mechs, and other tech.
Sam chooses the scrapper background fro Kaleem. She notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives her.

Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her
friends.

She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the
universe is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.

```
```

### 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your character’s __starting equipment__, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring
gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You
have a number of __credits__ to spend based on your _race_ (not your class as in D&D 5th). The range of average starting credits
is roughly equivalent across races, but the variability changes based on race. Long-lived races (asari and krogan) have lower
variability, whereas short-lived races (salarians and vorcha) have a high variability.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry and armor you can wear. Try not to purchase equipment with
a total weight exceeding your Strength score times 2. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.

#### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in combat. Things that contribute to your
AC include the armor you wear and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor, however.

Without armor, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor,
calculate your AC using the rules in the Armor section of chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor to wear and use it effectively, and your armor proficiencies are
determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
chapter 5.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give
you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

#### Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage
you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient
with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

For attacks with __melee weapons__, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_finesse_ property, such as a monomolecular blade, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

For attacks with __ranged weapons__, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_recoil_ property, such as the M-300 Claymore, can use your Strength modifier instead.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 5
Sam writes down the starting equipment from the engineer class and the scrapper background. Her starting equipment
includes Stock Medium Armor which (after adding her Dexterity modifier) gives Kaleem an Armor Class of 16.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>

\page


For Kaleem’s weapons, Sam chooses an M-8 Avenger (because she took the Assault Rifle proficiency) and an Omni-torch.
Her M-8 Avenger is a ranged weapon, so Kaleem uses her Dexterity modifier for her attacks and damage. Her attack bonus is
her Dexterity modifier (+2) plus her proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +4. The M-8 Avenger deals 1d8 piercing damage,
and Kaleem adds her Dexterity modifier to the damage when she hits, for a total of 1d8 + 2 piercing damage. Notice, 
she does not add her proficiency bonus to the damage roll, only the attack roll. When using the
Omni-torch, a melee weapon, Kaleem adds her Strength modifier (+1) to the attack roll and the damage roll. But, because 
she is not proficient with melee weapons, she does not add her proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### 6. Coming Together

Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a __party__, a group of operatives working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the galaxy.
Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts
of assignments the group might undertake.


## Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on missions and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience
points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called
__gaining a level__.

### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description.
Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases
at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll,
and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his
Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8 (1 additional hit point for each level).

### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20 and the
proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see
what other improvements you gain at each level.

### Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them;
they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the __first tier__ (levels 1–4), characters are effectively rookies. They are learning the features 
that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features.
The threats they face are relatively minor, usually dealing with street gangs, small crimes, or loose pyjaks.

In the __second tier__ (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Operatives should start acquiring __uncommon__ level 
equipment, increasing their combat potential. These characters have become important members of their factions (if they have
one), facing organized crime syndicates like the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack, and deal with threats to small colonies 
and medium-sized corporations.

In the __third tier__ (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of noteriety that sets them high above the ordinary 
populace and makes them special even among other operatives. This tier is equivalent to reaching N7 and would
be the tier at which Shepard started in Mass Effect 1. Operatives gain access to __rare__ quality weapons and armor and might 
begin crafting their own unique armor with capabilities that further their potential. These operatives often confront threats 
to whole cities, are conscripted my major corporations to protect valuable assets, and are sent unexplored and dangerous
planets. Additionally, within this tier, the party generally acquires their own personal starship which opens up
travel across the galaxy.

At the __fourth tier__ (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic 
(or villainous) archetypes in their own right. They begin collecting __spectre__ level equipment, the very best the galaxy
can offer. The fate of the entire universe might hang in the balance during their adventures.
