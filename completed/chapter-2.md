# Chapter 2: Races

The Citadel is a massive construct, similar in shape to a pentagram. The Presidium — the central, park-like
complex containing the offices of the various branches of the galactic government — connects 5 Wards — the 
residential and commercial sectors of the station. Each ward is a city in its own right, with hover cars, high 
rises, and crowded streets. The denizens of the Citadel, and those planets throughout the galaxy, are a myriad 
of alien races. From the beautiful and charismatic asari, to the gruff and militaristic turians. The salarians
take jobs as scientists and the volus sell the salarian invetions. Other races, like the Geth, may be considered
a threat (depending on when you set your campaign), and in the year 2184, a Quarian is a rare sight, only
venturing out into the galaxy when on their pilgrimage.

## Choosing a Race

The Mass Effect races each have a unique standing in the galactic community. Here we present the current 
racial atmosphere as of the Mass Effect games. Though far into the past (or future), you may change how
the races are precieved.

At this point in history, there are three tiers to galactic influence. The highest influence is having a 
seat at the Citadel Council, the governing body of the Citadel. The asari, salarians, and turians have all 
had seats for hundreds of years. In 2183, humans are granted a council seat in recompense for Commander
Shepard's heroic actions against Saren and the Reaper, Sovereign.

The next level of influence is having an embassy on the Citadel. These races include: elcor, hanar,
and volus. While the drell are too underpopulated to maintain their own embassey, they are represented by the
hanar.

While members of the remaining races are allowed on the citadel and have their own governments, they lack
embassies and galactic governmental involvement. The batarians left over disputes with the humans. Quarians
left after their homeworld was overrun by the geth. Krogans were cast out of the citadel after the Krogan
rebellions and the vorcha are too wild and aggressive to maintain a standing government.


Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. When making this decision, keep in mind
the kind of character you want to play. For example, a drell could be a good choice for a stealthy infiltrator,
a krogan makes a tough soldier, and an asari can be a master of biotics. Your character race not only affects
your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s
description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including
personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are
suggestions to help you think about your character; operatives can deviate widely from the norm for their race.
It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s
background and personality.

### Galaxy Restrictions
The available races are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. These distinctions are
based on Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most
races had an Ark for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy. And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may
have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians were recruited as security assets on Ark
Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that we've deemed
inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master. See 
the Introduction for more information about the two galaxies.

### Class Restrictions
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to
Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. The race/class combinations 
available are based on the _Mass Effect 3_ and _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ multiplayer formats.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. You are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Master about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the
decision concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, Mass Effect Wiki's _Biotics_ page 
has a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled _Alien Biotics_ and 
_Biotics in Andromeda_. If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.


### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following 
entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores. 

#### Age 
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected
lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can
choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For
example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or
Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment 
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for 
player characters, but considering why your turian is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful turian 
society can help you better define your character.

#### Size 
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 1.5 to 2.5 meters 
tall. The volus are Small (between 1 and 1.5 meters tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect
them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy
weapons, as explained in chapter 5.

#### Speed 
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

```
```

#### Starting Credits
Another change in Mass Effect 5e is that your available starting credits (fully explained in chapter 5)
are attributed to your race. The formula used for the race's starting credits is based on their lifespan.
Longer-lived races (asari and krogan) have larger dice pools but smaller dice. Whereas, short-lived races
have the opposite (small dice pools but larger dice). This represents the probability (and luck) of how many
credits your character has amassed over the years.

#### Variants
Some races have variants. These races are exist to represent the gamut of available races in the galaxy
but the variants are much rarer (like the Ardat-Yakshi) or unlikely to fit within a regular campaign
setting (like the Awakened Collector). In the cast of Humans, the variant is simply a different starting
set of ratial traits in case your GM is allowing feats.
