## Elcor

Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are 
incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature as well as thick, tough skin. They move using 
all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies. Given their method of communication, they have highly-attuned 
olfactory senses. They also have at least three stomachs.

### Language of Smells and Sight
Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely 
slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle 
as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor 
prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.

### Migratory Nature
Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept 
their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season.
However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.

### Living Tanks
Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions 
necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable 
hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and 
their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons 
typically mounted on military vehicles.

### Elcor Names
Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular,
they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.

### Elcor Traits
Your elcor character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of evolution.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. The average elcor lives to be around 300 years old. 100-year-old elcor are considered young.

__Alignment__. Elcor are methodical, deliberate creatures that never act on irrational decisions. The typical Elcor is often neutral or lawful.

__Size__. Elcor stand between 2 and 2.5 meters tall (7-8 feet) at the shoulder. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Elcor are relatively slow compared to other races. Your base walking speed is 6m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Careful__. You have proficiency in Insight and Perception. But your careful nature makes you slow to act, giving you disadvantage on 
Initiative rolls.  

__Quadrupedal__. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your size and weight. 
When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra meters, instead of the normal 2 extra meters.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue 
to act independently, not as a controlled mount.

__Shoulder Mounts__. Your ranged weapons are shoulder mounted to your armor or in holsters and use a VI to aim and fire. When you make a
ranged weapon attack, use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

You can have one ranged weapon mounted on each shoulder. Mounting a ranged weapon requires you to be proficient with
the weapon type and takes at least 10 minutes of work during a short or long rest.

__Thick Hide__. Your base AC is 12 and you determine your AC using your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.
