# Chapter 4: Personality and Background

Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

## Character Details
Your character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. 

### Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even
if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your
character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. For example, asari only have a single "gender", which
is generally seen by other races as female (they also utilize female pronouns). But an asari considers herself as androgynous
or hermaphroditic. You could also play a male character who presents himself as a female, a woman who feels trapped in
a male body, or a tough looking female krogan who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s
sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description. Think about
what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin.
A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in centimeters) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in kilograms) beyond the base weight. 

```
```

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment
is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes
toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently
faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

__Lawful good (LG)__ creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Asari justicars, quarians,
and some turians are lawful good.

__Neutral good (NG)__ beings do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many salarians and most
protheans are neutral good.

__Chaotic good (CG)__ creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.
Some angara, asari, and a number of humans are chaotic good.

__Lawful neutral (LN)__ individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Some geth, volus, and
most drell are lawful neutral.

__Neutral (N)__ is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what
seems best at the time. Volus, some batarians, and many humans are neutral.

__Chaotic neutral (CN)__ creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.
Maiden asari, some vorcha, and humans are chaotic neutral.

__Lawful evil (LE)__ creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or
order. Most Krogan, volus, and batarians are lawful evil.

__Neutral evil (NE)__ is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.
Heretic geth, Reapers, and vorcha are neutral evil.

__Chaotic evil (CE)__ creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
Some Krogan, batarians, and some Vorcha are chaotic evil.

### Languages

Languages are not a part of Mass Effect 5e. Our interpretation is that there is enough technology to translate languages
on the fly, making it seem that everyone is speaking the same common tongue. Even new discovered races can have their
languages mapped into a universal translator in a number of hours utilizing underlying linguistic morphisms and lexical
cues fed into a supercomputer. However, how you and your GM choose to handle ancient or alien languages is up to your party.
Your asari archaeologist might be an expert in ancient alien glyphs or you might lay a Krogan who is known for reciting
poetry in an old dialect. This type of flavor is encouraged, but this system does not codify any specific languages.

```
```

### Personal Characteristics

Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person
a unique identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are
presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s
favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your
imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.

#### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart
from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.
They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.
“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells
you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character
dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define
one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,
or be cocky about your high score.

#### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental
moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to
make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background
includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.
The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

#### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.
They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against
your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations
and goals.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUNDS</div>

\page

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?
What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or
personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.

#### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness —
in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.
More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you?
What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the galaxy master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or
her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.

### Gaining Inspiration
Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your
personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a
compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your
inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply
doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story
in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.


## Variant: Paragon & Renegade
With the Variant: Paragon & Renegade (P/R) rule, players accrue points in either Paragon or Renegade which can add
bonuses to skill checks.

### Earning Points
The primary way to each Paragon or Renegade points is by taking actions or role-playing that personality. This mechanic
works similarly rewarding Inspiration (described above), but the reward can be 1-5 points based on the impact of the
choice and whether the choice aligns with Paragon or Renegade. GMs can also reward points to the entire party based on a
decision they make while playing the game. Did the party destroy the potentially life-threatening biological weapon
(Renegade) or send it to authorities for research in vaccinations (Paragon).

### Point maximum
You can gain points in Paragon and Renegade, but your total combined points can never be more than 100.
For Galaxy Masters, you want to award about 5 points of paragon or renegade per player level. I.e., a level 20 character
should have about 100 points if they added their P/R scores together.

### Using points
Your Paragon and Renegade points can add a bonus to skill checks. You gain a +1 bonus to your skill check for every
10 Paragon or Renegade points you have. For example, if you had 14 Paragon points and 22 Renegade points, you would
add +1 to any paragon rolls and +2 to any renegade rolls.

A Paragon or Renegade roll is any skill check in which your GM allows your P/R bonus to augment the outcome of the roll.
It's the player's responsibility to ask the Galaxy Master about adding the P/R bonus, but the Galaxy Master can
proactively ask for a check with the P/R bonus added.

When to or when not to apply P/R bonus to a roll is entirely up to the GM. However, the rule of thumb is that the
action taken is more Paragon-like or more Renegade-like than what an average sentient being would do.

### Paragon vs Renegade
What constitutes Paragon and what constitutes Renegade is a bit fuzzy. Paragon is neither Lawful nor Good, just as Renegade
is neither Evil nor Chaotic. However, both traits _tend_ to fall closer to those respective spectra.

Try to think of Paragon and Renegade flavors of a character's or party's choices. Paragon choices are open-ended,
allowing for future possibilities, utilitarian (benefits the most people), logical, and rely on the pen over the sword.
Renegade choices are decisive and final, emotional, gain immediate results, and often use a show of force.

#### Paragon examples
___
- __Acrobatics.__ jump in front of a bullet to protect someone
- __Athletics.__ Hold fast a door why your party escapes a threat
- __Intimidation.__ Threaten someone with justice
- __Medicine.__ Stabilize an enemy because they might provide information
- __Vehicle Handling.__: Lead your chasers right to the authorities

#### Renegade examples
___
- __Athletics.__ Hold fast a door so the threat burns inside
- __Deception.__ Convince the bounty hunters their target fled into that cave (which happens to be booby-trapped)
- __Electronics.__ Broadcast the controversial research to the galaxy, let the politicians and scientists figure it out
- __Intimidation.__ Threaten someone with pain
- __Vehicle Handling.__ Lead your chasers right into a reinforced-steel wall

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an operative, and
your place in the galaxy. Your soldier might have been a mercenary or a former Specter. Your adept could have been a
government experiment or a celebrated artisan. Your infiltrator might be a political assassin or gathered intel for the
Shadow Broker.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question
to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?
Where did you get the credits to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.


#### Proficiencies 
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5. If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. 

```
```

#### Equipment 
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional starting credits for your race from chapter 2 to spend credits on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. 

#### Suggested Characteristics 
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. 

#### Customizing a Background 
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend credits on gear as described in chapter 2. (If you spend credits, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

___
- __Skill Proficiencies__. Survival, plus your choice of one from among Medicine, Science, and Vehicle Handling.
- __Tool Proficiencies__. Choose one from among an artisan tool, medical kit, tinker's tools, vehicles (air), vehicles (land), or vehicles (water)
- __Equipment__. A set of clothes, 500 credits, and choose one tool among an artisan tool, a medical kit, or tinker's tools.

#### Feature: Colony's Bond
While within your colony, you can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them.
They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A colonist is generally not far traveled and has lived most their life on a single planet. However, colonies can vary in size,
governmental structure, and socioeconomic status. Colonists see their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming,
and their home communities remain very important to them.

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a starship for yourself and your adventuring

by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your

you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

or gain access to normally off-limits locations by leveraging your position as a doctor if your services are needed.

something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a city district or colony where you have performed, they typically
take a liking to you.

without it suspecting something (other than what you offer).

```
```

#### Alternate Feature: Unrequited Love
At some point in your service, a patron became obsessed with you, expressing his undying
love and vowing to protect you at all costs. Whenever you are in need, you can request this patron's aid. As long as you feign
reciprocal feelings they will fulfill your request to the best of their abilities, even to the point of sacrificing their life for you.


#### Suggested Characteristics
When creating an Escort, think about how they feel about their situation. Do they enjoy their work? Do they hate it?
Is there a reason they're doing it? This can be useful in deciding how your Courtesan will act.

### Experiment
___

- __Tool Proficiencies__. Tinker's Tools and your choice of Medical Kit, Disguise Kit, or Chemist's Supplies.
- __Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a trinket from your program of origin, Tinker's Tools, and 300 credits.

#### Feature: What Doesn't Kill You 
You were the subject of experimentation in your youth, with the goal of stripping
away the old you and turning you into a weapon. The program could have been funded by your race's government, a
shadow organization, or a single mad scientist who kidnapped you. It could have had the goal of turning you into the
ultimate soldier, perhaps an unrivaled biotic, or even a genius tech engineer.

Regardless of the program's nature or success, you survived your difficult trials and came out tougher for it. You've
been pushed to the edge of death before, so it doesn't scare you. Once per long rest, you can choose to make a death
saving throw with advantage due to your strong drive to survive.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Experiments are all maladjusted to society, but not all experiments are unable to adapt. Most experiments prefer to be loners
and come off as aloof or emotionless. Over time, with a close-knit group, some experiments tend to open up and show a softer side.

- __Equipment__. A disguise kit, a set thieves' tools or hacking tools, a badge or emblem of your faction, a set of bio-encryption keys, and 1,000 credits

#### Feature: Safe Haven 
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and other agents who can
provide assistance. You know a set of secret signs, encrypted communication channels, and passwords you can use to identify
such agents, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Faction 
As a faction agent, you're part of a larger faction, which could be criminal, military, religious, political, etc.
You can work with your GM to create a faction or you can use an existing one from the Mass Effect Universe. Some faction
examples are the Shadow Broker Network, Blue Suns, Special Tasks Group, Cerberus, Eclipse, and the Blood Pack. Agents
are more than hired mercenaries and are supportive of their faction's efforts.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Faction Agents are shaped by their experience in the line of duty. The beliefs, laws, and practices of their faction can
affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy that counteracts the tenets of their faction.
For example, a Shadow Broker Agent that secretly wants transparency of information. Or they might have an ideal or bond
that is taken to an extreme, such as a Cerberus agent that hates all non-human races and kills them whenever possible.
