# Introduction

The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e
takes that storytelling to the stars. Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,
D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how
an N7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.

<div class='descriptive'>
###### In Mass Effect 5e, the Dungeon Master is called the __Galaxy Master__

<br>

__Galaxy Master (GM)__: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile
lock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite
side of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defense system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears
to be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals
on your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge
of the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in.

__Amanda (playing Melphine)__: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.

__Amie (playing Telos)__: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.
Do I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?
</div>

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’
action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,
roll away from the strike of a biotic attack, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,
but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

<div class='descriptive'>
__Galaxy Master (GM)__: OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?

__Amanda__: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?

__GM__: Make a Wisdom check.

__Amanda__: Does my Perception skill apply?

__GM__: Of course!

__Amanda (rolling a d20)__: Rats. I rolled a six, plus two for my perception skill modifier. So, Eight.

__GM__: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?
</div>

In the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other
operatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,
the glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.
The operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies
and relics from a past age.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates
missions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the
entrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?
Propel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, "affixing" themselves to the surface of
the asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM
can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each
mission can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a
__campaign__. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends
every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each
monster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also
earns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.
Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an
operative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,
the other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the
player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,
but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## A Universe to Explore

Mass Effect spans two galaxies: the Milky Way and Andromeda. Both have biotics, advanced tech, brave soldiers and fantastic
missions. But the galaxies are vastly different. The Milky Way has been settled by sentient beings for millennia and most of
its clusters, star systems, and planets have been charted and explored. It's also home to a variety of sentient alien species,
all with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar
with the first Mass Effect video games, you can read about major events and lore at the
[Mass Effect Wiki](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki). Specifically, the
[timeline](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline) can get you quickly up to speed to on the events
of the galaxy.

The Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of "Remnant" seem to exist on every planet, connected
by seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient races existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way
races. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way
races arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like
to read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda,
[the wiki](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda#Setting) has plenty of information.

Both galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but
each galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.
You could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign
on the timeline, you might also deal with the impending invasion of the Reapers.
In contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of
setting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way
is an urban setting with a defined lore and timeline. Andromeda is rural and more of a sandbox for campaigns.

Your GM might set the campaign in one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so
much diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house
rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,
even if the setting is a published world.

It is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies. The passengers of Andromeda's arks
spent 600 years in cryo-sleep. But you could certainly spend part of your campaign in the Milky Way and take a 600-year nap!

## Using these Rules

This manual uses the [Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)
as its core rule set. If you have never played D&D 5e, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basic rules
first. Most of those rules are replicated and referenced in the rules section of this Player's Manual.

Not repeated here are basic rules for Dungeon (Galaxy) Masters which have additional rules on running successful campaigns.


> ##### VARIANT RULES
Occasionally, you'll see a rule preceded by the word "Variant". This means the rule is optional. In some cases,
it may replace an existing rule. For example, the Variant: Encumbrance rule replaces the standard Lifting & Carrying rules.
In other instances, the rule may be completely ignored. For example, the Paragon & Renegade system adds rules for utilizing
paragon and renegade points. While this adds a nice touch of flavor from the original _Mass Effect_ trilogy, it is not required
for this system to work, and it can safely be left out of your campaign if desired.

  style='width:325px' />

## How to Play

The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.

__1. The GM describes the environment.__
The GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, detailing the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).

__2. The players describe what they want to do.__
Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different
operatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol
spray-painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens
to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say
that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some
other circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what
happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>INTRODUCTION</div>

\page

__3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.__
Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds, whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or
locked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is
more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.



Often the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal
descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many
players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the
game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a
scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

### Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many
bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different
ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are
numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.
In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.
For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the
number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on
whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

```
```

### The D20

Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari
believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation
grenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters
might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are
the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of
the game. All three follow these simple steps.

__1. Roll the die and add a modifier.__
Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for
details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)

__2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.__
A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

__3. Compare the total to a target number.__
If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,
it’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a __Difficulty Class (DC)__. The target number for an
attack roll is called an __Armor Class (AC)__.

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the
d20 in the game.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.
Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you
have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if
you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17
and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.

### Specific Beats General
This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,
gadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how
the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every
soldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking
are more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.
Biotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you
end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.


## Missions

The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each
character brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,
racial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best
party of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.
The operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.

The mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras
in a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.

Over the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations
that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture
each other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And
often, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the
current situation. All along, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what
they’ll try to do next.

Aissions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no
more than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other
challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end
of a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of
their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of
multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group
of operatives following the narrative from start to finish.

### The Three Pillars of a mission

__Exploration__ includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations
that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters
to do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the
characters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On
the smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.

__Social interaction__ features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a
captured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemy's stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for
mercy from a krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.

The rules in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> and
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions">Missions</nuxt-link> support exploration
and social interaction.

__Combat__, the focus of the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link> section, involves characters and other creatures
shooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a
game session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a
pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for operatives to attempt wacky stunts like surfing on a drone,
to examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
## Overview

Your first step in playing an operative in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character
is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or asari)
and a class (such as sentinel or vanguard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the universe.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of operative you want to play. You might be a courageous soldier,
a skulking infiltrator, a fervent sentinel, or a flamboyant adept. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny engineer who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. The
conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with
a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this section, the term __character sheet__ means whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a
formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.


#### Building Kaleem
Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Sam building her salarian character, Kaleem.


### 1. Choose a Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character races are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. Some races also have subraces, such as
pure-blood asari or tank-bred krogan. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

```
```

#### Building Kaleem, Step 1
Sam is sitting down to create her character. She decides that a wiley salarian fits the character she wants to play and
she knows she wants to play with tech spells available to the engineer or infiltrator class, both of which are available
classes for the salarian race. She notes all the racial traits of salarians on her character sheet, including her speed
of 10m and Medium size.


### 2. Choose a Class

Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she
possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging
in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are __class features__ — capabilities
(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of
__proficiencies__: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things
your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level

#### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining __experience points__ (XP). A
1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate
and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the
game, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the
assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your
class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level
character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).

>##### Quick Build
Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>

\page

#### Hit Points and Hit Die
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points
are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal
to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which
you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the
number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
Resting in chapter 8).

#### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>, tools
in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#tools-kits">Equipment</nuxt-link>.) Your background gives you additional skill and
tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of
these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency
bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.


#### Building Kaleem, Step 2
Sam imagines Keleem firing tech spells from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’
proficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.

As a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.
Sam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also
notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.


### 3. Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: __Strength__, __Dexterity__, __Constitution__,
__Intelligence__, __Wisdom__, and __Charisma__. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary provides a quick reference 
for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability
particularly important.

You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest
three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time
or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores
as a result of your race choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.
To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result
by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

<div style='column-count:2'>
| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | -5 |
| 2 - 3 | -4 |
| 4 - 5 | -3 |
| 6 - 7 | -2 |
| 8 - 9 | -1 |
| 10 - 11 | 0 |
| 12 - 13 | 1 |
  | 14 - 15 | 2 |

```
```

| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |
| 16 - 17 | 3 |
| 18 - 19 | 4 |
| 20 - 21 | 5 |

| 24 - 25 | 7 |
| 26 - 27 | 8 |
| 28 - 29 | 9 |
| 30 | 10 |
</div>


#### Building Kaleem, Step 3
Sam decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Kaleem’s abilities. Since she’s an engineer,
she puts her highest score, 15, in Intelligence. Her next-highest, 14, goes in Dexterity. Kaleem might be a charismatic,
good leader, but Sam decides she wants the salarian to be tougher and stronger than most of her kind, so she puts decent
scores in Strength and Constitution. After applying her racial benefits (increasing Kaleems’s Intelligence by 2 and her
Dexterity by 1), Kaleem’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 15 (+2),
Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 17 (+3), Wisdom 10 (0), Charisma 8 (-1).

Sam fills in Kaleem’s final hit points: 8 + her Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.

#### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
At your Galaxy Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here
allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost
table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,
before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15,
15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers
between those extremes.

##### Ability Score Point Cost

<div style='column-count:2'>
| Score | Cost |

| Score | Cost |
| :---: | :---: |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |
</div>


### 4. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a
name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your
character’s __alignment__ (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and __ideals__. Chapter 4 also helps you identify
the things your character holds most dear, called __bonds__, and the __flaws__ that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s __background__ describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in
the Mass Effect universe. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing
to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give
you proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your
character sheet.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>
  
\page

#### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 4
Sam lets her ability scores influence the type of character Kaleem is: her high Intelligence suggests a rapid, focused
mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or
awkward social decorum.

Sam fills in some of Kaleem’s basic details: her name, her sex (female), her height and weight, and the fact that she
is missing a cranial ridge (making her unattractive being by salarian standards).

Sam picks a lawful alignment for Kaleem, as she buys into the tradition of the Blue Suns and respects their codes. Kaleem's
lack of empathy makes her neutral in her disposition for moral codes.

Sam decides that Kaleem comes from a lowly background, rummaging the slums of Omega. When she was caught stealing equipment
from the Blue Suns, the general spared her life but put her to work scrapping and repairing weapons, mechs, and other tech.
Sam chooses the scrapper background fro Kaleem. She notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives her.

Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her
friends.

She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the
universe is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.

```
```

### 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your character’s __starting equipment__, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring
gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You
have a number of __credits__ to spend based on your _race_ (not your class as in D&D 5th). The range of average starting credits
is roughly equivalent across races, but the variability changes based on race. Long-lived races (asari and krogan) have lower
variability, whereas short-lived races (salarians and vorcha) have a high variability.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry and armor you can wear. Try not to purchase equipment with
a total weight exceeding your Strength score times 2. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.

#### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in combat. Things that contribute to your
AC include the armor you wear and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor, however.

Without armor, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor,
calculate your AC using the rules in the Armor section of chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor to wear and use it effectively, and your armor proficiencies are
determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
chapter 5.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give
you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

#### Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage
you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient
with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

For attacks with __melee weapons__, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_finesse_ property, such as a monomolecular blade, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

For attacks with __ranged weapons__, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_recoil_ property, such as the M-300 Claymore, can use your Strength modifier instead.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 5
Sam writes down the starting equipment from the engineer class and the scrapper background. Her starting equipment
includes Stock Medium Armor which (after adding her Dexterity modifier) gives Kaleem an Armor Class of 16.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>

\page


For Kaleem’s weapons, Sam chooses an M-8 Avenger (because she took the Assault Rifle proficiency) and an Omni-torch.
Her M-8 Avenger is a ranged weapon, so Kaleem uses her Dexterity modifier for her attacks and damage. Her attack bonus is
her Dexterity modifier (+2) plus her proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +4. The M-8 Avenger deals 1d8 piercing damage,
and Kaleem adds her Dexterity modifier to the damage when she hits, for a total of 1d8 + 2 piercing damage. Notice, 
she does not add her proficiency bonus to the damage roll, only the attack roll. When using the
Omni-torch, a melee weapon, Kaleem adds her Strength modifier (+1) to the attack roll and the damage roll. But, because 
she is not proficient with melee weapons, she does not add her proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### 6. Coming Together

Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a __party__, a group of operatives working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the galaxy.
Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts
of assignments the group might undertake.


## Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on missions and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience
points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called
__gaining a level__.

### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description.
Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases
at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll,
and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his
Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8 (1 additional hit point for each level).

### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20 and the
proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see
what other improvements you gain at each level.

### Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them;
they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the __first tier__ (levels 1–4), characters are effectively rookies. They are learning the features 
that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features.
The threats they face are relatively minor, usually dealing with street gangs, small crimes, or loose pyjaks.

In the __second tier__ (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Operatives should start acquiring __uncommon__ level 
equipment, increasing their combat potential. These characters have become important members of their factions (if they have
one), facing organized crime syndicates like the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack, and deal with threats to small colonies 
and medium-sized corporations.

In the __third tier__ (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of noteriety that sets them high above the ordinary 
populace and makes them special even among other operatives. This tier is equivalent to reaching N7 and would
be the tier at which Shepard started in Mass Effect 1. Operatives gain access to __rare__ quality weapons and armor and might 
begin crafting their own unique armor with capabilities that further their potential. These operatives often confront threats 
to whole cities, are conscripted my major corporations to protect valuable assets, and are sent unexplored and dangerous
planets. Additionally, within this tier, the party generally acquires their own personal starship which opens up
travel across the galaxy.

At the __fourth tier__ (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic 
(or villainous) archetypes in their own right. They begin collecting __spectre__ level equipment, the very best the galaxy
can offer. The fate of the entire universe might hang in the balance during their adventures.

# Chapter 2: Races

The Citadel is a massive construct, similar in shape to a pentagram. The Presidium — the central, park-like
complex containing the offices of the various branches of the galactic government — connects 5 Wards — the 
residential and commercial sectors of the station. Each ward is a city in its own right, with hover cars, high 
rises, and crowded streets. The denizens of the Citadel, and those planets throughout the galaxy, are a myriad 
of alien races. From the beautiful and charismatic asari, to the gruff and militaristic turians. The salarians
take jobs as scientists and the volus sell the salarian invetions. Other races, like the Geth, may be considered
a threat (depending on when you set your campaign), and in the year 2184, a Quarian is a rare sight, only
venturing out into the galaxy when on their pilgrimage.

## Choosing a Race

The Mass Effect races each have a unique standing in the galactic community. Here we present the current 
racial atmosphere as of the Mass Effect games. Though far into the past (or future), you may change how
the races are precieved.

At this point in history, there are three tiers to galactic influence. The highest influence is having a 
seat at the Citadel Council, the governing body of the Citadel. The asari, salarians, and turians have all 
had seats for hundreds of years. In 2183, humans are granted a council seat in recompense for Commander
Shepard's heroic actions against Saren and the Reaper, Sovereign.

The next level of influence is having an embassy on the Citadel. These races include: elcor, hanar,
and volus. While the drell are too underpopulated to maintain their own embassey, they are represented by the
hanar.

```
```

<div style='text-align: right; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic'>
[Citadel Nightlife by /u/Nahdude653](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/7p76yz/no_spoilers_citadel_nightlife/)
</div>

While members of the remaining races are allowed on the citadel and have their own governments, they lack
embassies and galactic governmental involvement. The batarians left over disputes with the humans. Quarians
left after their homeworld was overrun by the geth. Krogans were cast out of the citadel after the Krogan
rebellions and the vorcha are too wild and aggressive to maintain a standing government.


Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. When making this decision, keep in mind
the kind of character you want to play. For example, a drell could be a good choice for a stealthy infiltrator,
a krogan makes a tough soldier, and an asari can be a master of biotics. Your character race not only affects
your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s
description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including
personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are
suggestions to help you think about your character; operatives can deviate widely from the norm for their race.
It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s
background and personality.

### Galaxy Restrictions
The available races are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. These distinctions are
based on Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most
races had an Ark for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy. And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may
have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians were recruited as security assets on Ark
Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that we've deemed
inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master. See 
the Introduction for more information about the two galaxies.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>


\page

### Class Restrictions
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to
Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. The race/class combinations 
available are based on the _Mass Effect 3_ and _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ multiplayer formats.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. You are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Master about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the
decision concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, Mass Effect Wiki's _Biotics_ page 
has a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled _Alien Biotics_ and 
_Biotics in Andromeda_. If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.


### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following 
entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores. 

#### Age 
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected
lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can
choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For
example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or
Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment 
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for 
player characters, but considering why your turian is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful turian 
society can help you better define your character.

#### Size 
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 1.5 to 2.5 meters 
tall. The volus are Small (between 1 and 1.5 meters tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect
them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy
weapons, as explained in chapter 5.

#### Speed 
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

```
```

#### Starting Credits
Another change in Mass Effect 5e is that your available starting credits (fully explained in chapter 5)
are attributed to your race. The formula used for the race's starting credits is based on their lifespan.
Longer-lived races (asari and krogan) have larger dice pools but smaller dice. Whereas, short-lived races
have the opposite (small dice pools but larger dice). This represents the probability (and luck) of how many
credits your character has amassed over the years.

When you optionally choose to use your racial starting credits, you do not gain any recommended equipment packages
from your chosen class nor your chosen background.

#### Variants
Some races have variants. These races are exist to represent the gamut of available races in the galaxy
but the variants are much rarer (like the Ardat-Yakshi) or unlikely to fit within a regular campaign
setting (like the Awakened Collector). In the cast of Humans, the variant is simply a different starting
set of ratial traits in case your GM is allowing feats.

## Angara

The angara are warm-blooded mammals with relatively broad shoulders, narrow waists and skin colors of blue or mauve, 
sometimes shading into green or tan. They are the only known extant 
sapient race native to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda galaxy, and arose on the planet Havarl. Their unique
physiology is dependant on sunlight and allows them to produce natural bioelectrical fields. The angara as a people 
are very free with their emotions, demonstrative and "larger than life". If they love you they hug you, if
they hate you or if you make them mad, they punch you. 

### Creatures of the Sun
The angara electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from stars to survive. Lack of real or artificial sunlight causes 
them to "go dark", which weakens their immune systems and bio-energy significantly. Prolonged lack of sunlight can lead 
to a coma and then death. To supplement their sunlight intake or provide a light source when natural light is not 
readily available, the angara make use of powerful ultraviolet lamps that give them both heat and light.

### Family Oriented
While they have only one true mother and father, the angara share their parents with the community. Their 
families are very large, consisting of multiple mothers and many siblings and cousins. This close-knit society
makes angara very mistrustful of other races.

While the angara have many different religions, all share the same basic tenet: that when an angara dies, he or she is 
reincarnated and the reincarnated soul stays in the family, making their lineage stronger.

### Angara Names
Little is known about angaran names. But it is assumed that they do not use family names given the collective nature
of their families.

<div style='margin-top:350px'></div>

## Asari

Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a 
crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or 
gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction 
initiated by a "mind meld" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to 
randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to 
manipulate mass effect fields.

### Unmatched Patience
Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a "long view" not common in other races. When they encounter a new 
species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.
They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will 
inevitably influence the existing culture.

### Mothers of the Galaxy
Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the 
asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of 
DNA. 


The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, 
the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and 
as a "map" to randomize the genes of the offspring.

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/d/dc/Asari_Justicar_MP.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415182847&format=original' style='width:325px; margin-top: 125px' />

Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the "father" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown 
upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so 
it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as 
"purebloods", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes 
asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.

### Maiden, Matron, Matriarch
Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. 

The __Maiden__ stage 
begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and 
it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. 

The __Matron__ 
stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This 
period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. 

The __Matriarch__ stage begins around 700 years 
of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, 
dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.

However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity. 

### Asari Names
Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari 
parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with 
their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as "Matriarch" but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.
___
- __Personal Names__: Aeian, Aethyta, Aleena, Alestia, Aria, Batha, Benezia, Dahlia, Falere, Irissa, Jona, Liara, Lidanya,  Liselle, Mallene, Morinth, Nassana, Nyxeris, Pelessaria, Rana, Rila, Samara, Sarissa, Shiala, Tela, Tevos, Treeya
- __Surnames__: Ateyne, B'Sayle, Calis, D'Layne, D'Nava, D'Ysesan, Dantius, Iallis, Iasava, Janieri, Kelis, M'Loari, M'Taros, Makenus, Nuwani, Sedela, Sederis, T'Goni, T'Loak, T'Soni, Thanoptis, Theris, V'Lanis, V'Nato, V'Tizor, Vasir


### Asari Traits
Your asari character has an assortment of inborn abilities, all part of asari nature.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. Asari are very long-lived and can reach ages of over 1000 years.

__Alignment__. Asari are biased towards goodness, but exhibit a range of alignments not dissimilar to humans. Most Maiden stage asari are chaotic, Matrons level out to neutral, Matriarchs are heavily lawful.

__Size__. Asari have builds incredibly similar to female humans. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d4 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Innate Biotics__. Asari do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability
to project their will onto the world. As an Asari, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.

Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that class’s spell list. In addition,
choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast
it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of
the spell as your class permits.


__Mind Meld__. You can transfer and receive thoughts to another creature. You must concentrate and if the creature is not willing,
the thoughts become jumbled and disjointed. Unintelligent creatures have unpredictable results.


__Natural Diplomat__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.


### Variant: Ardat-Yakshi

A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in "purebloods" (2 asari parents).
The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct.
When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi 
develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addition only grows stronger with each meld, 
and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to leave in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to 
avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.


#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, you can choose to replace the _Alignment_ and _Mind Meld_ traits with the following.
Additionally, you gain the _Dominate_ trait at 10th level.

__Alignment__. Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.

__Mind Break__. You can touch a willing creature and initiate a mind meld. If the target is unwilling, the meld does not continue. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be 
rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a long rest.

__Dominate__. At 10th level, you learn the Dominate spell. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for this spell and it 
does not count against your max number spells known or prepared. You can cast a 3rd-level version of this spell
once per long rest.

## Batarian

A race of four-eyed bipeds with complexions of reddish-brown, greenish, yellow-greenish to yellow-brownish, light brown, or teal.
The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving 
rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average 
citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government.

### Caste Through Credits
Batarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance, and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. 
Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their 
way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a 
social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are 
less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other races find it difficult 
to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.

### The Hegemony
Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath 
the notice of the powerful Council races. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, 
and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from.
Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their 
supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains 
divided into various competing nation-states.

### Batarian Names
Like humans, batarian names consist of a given name and family name.
___
- __Male Names__: Afothor, Carn, Dhapo, Drathar, Ecray, Eporn, Irorok, Khamak, Okorem, Prathan, Sato, Sonk, Uderlak 
- __Female Names__: Apenine, Adrechia, Banim, Della, Erakis, Famisa, Fophe, Igosin, Iraphi, Kranine, Krathe, Okhefin, Pravile, Ramye
- __Family Names__: Can'dabar, Das'codah, Dhen'gess, Dran'fapos, Ghapsacan, Gronnopos, Kasbovran, Khognalak, Krak'gork, Pec'bawen, Sanrowar

### Batarian Traits
All batarians share a few select traits, instilled in them from birth by the hegemony.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

__Age__. Batarians age at about the same rate as humans, though many do not live past 100 due to their caustic and dangerous lifestyles.

__Alignment__. Because of the tenets of Hegemony, batarians tend to be lawful evil, although there are outliers on the moral spectrum.

__Size__. Batarian bodies are similar to humans, with the exception of a large forehead to accommodate their additional four eyes, making them about 15cm (6") taller. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 6d8 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Four Eyes__. You have proficiency in the Perception skill and you can take the Search action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

__Saving Face__. Batarians are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an
attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies
you can see (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.

__Shrewd Negotiator__. Gain proficiency in either Insight or Intimidation.

## Drell

Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with dense muscle tissue, giving them a wiry strength. Their skin is 
infused with a venom mild enough to be served in drinks and may cause mild hallucinations on oral contact. Drell
also possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource 
across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall and 
these recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality. 

### Homeworld Lost
The drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the already-arid 
drell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion. At the time, the drell 
lacked interstellar flight capacity, and with their population bursting at eleven billion, they faced certain doom.

It was around the 1980s CE that the hanar made first contact with the drell race. In the following ten years, the hanar 
would transport a total of 375,000 drell to the hanar homeworld, Kahje. The remaining billions left on Rakhana would 
perish on their dying planet, warring against each other for diminishing resources. 

### Servants of the Hanar
The debt of gratitude that the drell owe the hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the drell fulfill by taking on 
tasks that the hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve 
is a great honor, few turn down the offer. Some drell grow a close, personal relationship with the hanar, so much so 
that the hanar will even tell the drell their "soul name". Drell have adapted to communication with hanar by getting 
implants in their eyes to allow them to observe the bioluminescence the hanar use for communication.

### Devout
Most drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death as a 
departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or 
otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that their body can be 
directed as a separate entity from themselves, thus, some drell take no responsibility when executing an order given by 
the hanar even if the order is an assassination.

The religion includes at least three gods which drell often pray to for guidance and protection: 

- __Amonkira__, Lord of Hunters
- __Arashu__, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection
- __Kalahira__, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.

## Elcor

Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are 
incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature as well as thick, tough skin. They move using 
all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies. Given their method of communication, they have highly-attuned 
olfactory senses. They also have at least three stomachs.

### Language of Smells and Sight
Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely 
slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle 
as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor 
prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.

### Migratory Nature
Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept 
their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season.
However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.

### Living Tanks
Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions 
necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable 
hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and 
their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons 
typically mounted on military vehicles.

### Elcor Names
Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular,
they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.
___
- __Elcor Names__: Calyn, Cyllyn, Detinos, Delzino, Felitos, Fazuti, Halzan, Harrot, Pedezlan, Petelenti, Petozi, Vatozi, Voletzi, Xeltan, Zatzoni 

### Elcor Traits
Your elcor character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of evolution.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. The average elcor lives to be around 300 years old. 100-year-old elcor are considered young.

__Alignment__. Elcor are methodical, deliberate creatures that never act on irrational decisions. The typical Elcor is often neutral or lawful.

__Size__. Elcor stand between 2 and 2.5 meters tall (7-8 feet) at the shoulder. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Elcor are relatively slow compared to other races. Your base walking speed is 6m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Careful__. You have proficiency in Insight and Perception. But your careful nature makes you slow to act, giving you disadvantage on 
Initiative rolls.  

__Quadrupedal__. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your size and weight. 
When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra meters, instead of the normal 2 extra meters.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue 
to act independently, not as a controlled mount.

__Shoulder Mounts__. Your ranged weapons are shoulder mounted to your armor or in holsters and use a VI to aim and fire. When you make a
ranged weapon attack, use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

You can have one ranged weapon mounted on each shoulder. Mounting a ranged weapon requires you to be proficient with
the weapon type and takes at least 10 minutes of work during a short or long rest.

__Thick Hide__. Your base AC is 12 and you determine your AC using your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

## Geth
Former automatons build by the quarians to function as soldiers and laborers, geth are constructs that have 
unintentionally consciousness and sentience. Geth, meaning "servant of the people" in the quarian language of 
Khelish, are fundamentally different than other constructs and are designed with humanoid thought and emotion in mind.
Geth think, feel, and experience the world in a totally unique way.

### The Morning War
"Does this unit have a soul?" asked the geth. That question would change the relationship of quarians and geth forever. 
The quarians responded with an attempted termination of all geth. The newly sentient geth resisted the genocide of 
their masters in a war dubbed "the Morning War". As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly 
and easily defeated. Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their 
homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.

### Incomprehensible Mind
Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds 
powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic 
minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come 
to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. 
Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their 
innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even 
the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.

### Beyond the Veil
Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the 
Terminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. 
The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other 
quests.

### Geth Names
Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races. 
However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as "us" and "we". 
As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those 
who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though 
they give themselves a more personally fitting name.
___
- __Geth Names__: Armada, Army, Batallion, Brigade, Cabal, Caucus, Congregate, Coterie, Guild, Horde, Host, Legion, Myriad, Phalanx, Proletariat, Throng, Troop, Union
- __'Individual' Geth Names__: Alpha, Apex, Beta, Centurion, Enigma, Eternity, Genesis, Obelisk, Oblivion, Omega, Oracle, Pinnacle, Terminus, Vortex, Zenith

### Geth Traits
From a common build, geth share traits based on the mold from which they were formed.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

__Age__. Geth do not age, as they are constructs, and live as long as their bodies are not destroyed.

__Alignment__. Your standard Geth platform is neutral good, wanting to prosper and communicate with others, defending themselves only if threatened. Heretics are lawful evil, serving the Reapers and slavishly accomplishing their will.

__Size__. Standard geth are around 2 meters tall (6'5"). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 2d10 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__No Feats__. Geth cannot take any feats.


__Living Construct__. You are immune to psychic and poison damage, the poisoned condition, and disease. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping.
In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

<span style='padding-left: 12px;'>
__Integrated Protection__. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor,
but if you are wielding a weapon or shield that provides additional AC, you apply its bonus as normal.
</span>

You can alter your armor type for 2 omni-gel each time you finish a long rest. Choose one mode to adopt from the
Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode’s prerequisite.

<span style='font-size:12px;'>Mode</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>Prerequisite</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>AC</span>
:--- | :--- | ---
Lithe | None | 11 + your Dexterity Modifier. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Composite Plating | Medium armor proficiency | 12 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + proficiency bonus
Asymmetric Defense Plating | Heavy armor proficiency | 15 + proficiency bonus. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

__Innate Shielding.__ You have 5 shields (regen 5). You can upgrade these by using armor mods.

__Armor Mods.__ You can augment your armor by integrating armor mods into your system. You can spend 8 hours removing, adding, or
replacing a mod. When you remove or replace a mod in this way, the replaced or removed mod is lost. The mod cannot be salvaged,
not even with the assistance of Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools.

You have 2 chest mod slots, 1 mod slot in your arms, legs, and head each. You cannot add new slots in any way.

__Hunter Mode__. Geth were designed as lethal weapons and can activate subroutines to enhance their lethality.

As an action, you can activate Hunter Mode which lasts 1 minute and can only be used once
per long rest. Hunter Mode grants the following benefits:

- Increase movement by 2m.
- +1 bonus to ranged and melee weapon attack rolls.


At 11th level, you gain an additional benefit based on your class:

- *Engineer*. When you cast a spell, the die type of that spell increases by 1 die type (max d12). If the die type is already d12, add +1 for each die rolled instead.
- _Soldier_. Your extra attack features grants you 1 additional attack the first time you take the Attack action on your turn.
- _Infiltrator._ Increase your sneak attack die type to d8 (if you are a Shadow Infiltrator, your sneak attack for melee weapons attacks is a d10).


__Repair Matrix__. As a construct, you cannot be healed by medi-gel or spells that heal organic creatures (such as the _first aid_ spell).

Instead, you can use your Action to expend a Hit Die. Roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain 
hit points equal to the total. You also regain all spent hit dice at the end of a long rest, instead of the usual amount.

If you drop to 0 hit points, you must be stabilized with an Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Electronics) check, 
instead of a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

At the 4th level, you gain an additional number of hit dice equal to your character level divided by 4 (minimum 1). 
These bonus hit dice are d8s, regardless of your class.



### Variant: Unshackled AI

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. 
Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer 
called a "blue box". While most AI are "shackled" to the confines of networked computer traffic and lack a body,
occasionally, an AI is placed into a synthetic form, unshackling it.

AIs are considered illegal by the Council, but that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus from innovating. As an 
unshackled AI, you might be have been mass produced like the Alliance Infiltration Units, or you may be an experiment 
gone wrong.

#### Playing an Unshackled AI
Unshackled AIs are entirely unique. Since you are synthetic, you gain some of the synthetic traits as listed in the
Geth description. However, your mind, purpose, history, alignment, height, weight, and personality are entirely
your own. Technically, you can take any form you wish (work with your GM to decide if this new form gains any additional
traits). However, because AI are illegal, most unshackled AI would have a humanoid form, allowing them to blend into
society.

#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an Unshackled AI, you can choose to replace the _Ability Score Increase_, _Alignment_,
_Hunter Mode_, and _No Feats_ traits with the following.

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, one other score of your choosing that is not Intelligence increases by 1.

__Alignment__. If you are still following your programming you would be lawful with morality based on your purpose. If you have a glitch in your programming you might be chaotic. 

__Feat__. You gain one feat of your choice.

</div>


<div style='margin-top:330px'></div>


## Hanar

The hanar are a genderless species resembling Earth's jellyfish and are one of the few non-bipedal Citadel races. 
The hanar homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of 
clouds. Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call "the Enkindlers". 
Hanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know 
on a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as "this one," or the 
impersonal "it." Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even 
with those it wishes dead.

### Enkindlers
Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient 
species, calling them the "Enkindlers". The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or "First Cresting Bloom" which 
lasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to 
having come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized 
debates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in 
bio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.


### The Compact
Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society 
was quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several 
hundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining 
drell dying out.

  src='https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/blob/master/static/images/races/hanar.png?raw=true' 
  style='width:325px; margin-top: 70px' />

Now the drell serve as a client race of the hanar, and although to outside observers the 
relationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every 
level of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact. 
Many drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' "soul names".



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>


\page

### Language of Lights
The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness.
Other species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order 
to perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper 
language and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.


### Hanar Names
The hanar have two names, a "face name" and a "soul name." The face name is used as a general label for use by 
strangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.
___
- __Face Names__: Anrynder, Delanynder, Ellanpo, Hymydwhyn, Lopyldis, Malvyll, Opold, Sedlyner, Tolystoyl, Wynold, Zymandis
- __Soul Names__: Burns Brightest when the Foam Blooms, Casts Shadow on the Sun Flower, Emancipates the Tide from those that Pull, Heeds only to the Inner Lights, Illuminates the Folly of the Dancers, Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair, Transforms the Stone into Water 


### Hanar Traits
Their unique biology give you hanar character a few unique traits.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Adept, Engineer

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

__Age__. Hanar usually reach maturity around 40 years and typically live to be 180 years old.

__Alignment__. Most hanar are lawful due to the religious influence on their society.

__Size__. Due to their long tentacles, hanar "stand" about as tall as humans. Their bodies are around 1.5 meters long (4-5'). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Hanar are a water-based lifeform and have a swim speed of 10m. They rely on contra-gravitic levitation packs when not in water environments.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 6d8 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Amphibious__. Can breathe both air and water.


__Contra-gravitic Levitation__. When not in water, you use a contra-gravitic levitation pack to move. It provides a walking speed of 10m, though
you actually hover between 1 and 2 meters from the ground. You are immune to becoming prone and you ignore any penalties
caused by difficult terrain.

However, when you suffer a critical hit, you must roll a d20. On a 1 or a 2, the device malfunctions and you fall to the
ground. Your walking speed becomes 0 and you are considered prone. You or another creature can use an 
Action to repair the pack with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check.


__Bioluminescence__. You can shed dim light in a 10m radius.


__Fragile__. Your hit point maximum is decreased by 1. Every time you gain a level you gain 1 less hit point. 


__Tentacles__. You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms, meaning
you can only wield weapons with the _light_ property. 

As an action, you can use one of your tentacles to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a 
natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning 
damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 
Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action.

As an action, you can secrete a natural toxin from one of your tentacles. If a creature is grappled by the tentacle,
it must succeed a DC 11 Constitution saving throw of becomes poisoned for 1 hour. The DC of this
saving throw increases with your level: DC 13 at the 5th level, DC 15 at the 11th level, and DC 17 at the 17th level.

## Human


Humans are generally seen to be very intelligent, abnormally ambitious, highly adaptable, individualistic and thus, 
unpredictable. They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the 
normally staid Council races have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity.

### New Horizons
Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater 
on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established 
Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol.
In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that 
proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, 
explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.

### First Contact
Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, 
known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the System Alliance's swift and decisive action during the 
First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, 
humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel 
space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.

### Systems Alliance
The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human race, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the 
fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to 
their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a 
unified political entity represented by the Alliance.

### Galactic Relations
The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy 
compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly 
expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs. It took 
other species centuries to achieve what humanity has done in decades. 

### Human Names
Having so much more variety than other races, humans as a whole have no typical names.

```
```

### Human Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your ability scores each increase by 1.

__Age__. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live between 125 and 150 years.

__Alignment__. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

__Size__. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 1.5 meters to well over 2 meters tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 8d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

### Variant: Human
If your campaign uses the optional feat rules, your Galaxy Master might allow these variant traits, all of which replace 
the human’s _Ability Score Increase_ trait.

__Ability Score Increase__: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

__Skills__: You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

__Feat__: You gain one feat of your choice.

## Krogan


The krogan are a species of large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh 
environments, scarce resources, and an overabundance of vicious predators. The krogan managed to not only survive on their 
unforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more 
technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war 
that reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.

### Biologically Impervious
Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous 
plates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,
for the resources in Tuchanka are scare.

Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These 
traits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as "Blood Rage."

### Blood Rage
The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless 
killing machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and 
suppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant 
organs, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.

### Climb Atop the Dead
Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule 
and the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power. 
Even within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and 
will sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and 
live in clans separate from the males.

### Rites and Rituals
The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his 
first clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. 
When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.

A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and 
torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan 
and are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit 
world itself.

## Prothean

The Protheans are an ancient alien race which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a 
single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known 
about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.

### Ancient Empire
After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from 
those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the 
galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.

Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. 
To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire. 
The other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.

### Reaper Invasion
The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the 
Reapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They 
were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the 
Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems 
from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall. 

### Stasis
In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could
hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.
Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control
these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,
the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden
bunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.

### All Eyes on You
As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of 
speech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your 
way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued 
by your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.


### Avatars
Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular
virtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice, 
mercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,
it is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint
your own virtue.

### Prothean Names
Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor. Until they've chosen a name, they are 
called little one, child, or some other generic term.
___
- __Male names__: Arkath, Esrad, Caed, Dervan Had, Dencen, Hsed Mik, Javik, Jacen, Ksad Ishan, Lucen, Pashek Vran, Seset Amat, Tev Boken
- __Female names__: Athi Let, Brene She, Balani, Calise, Cethi, Cosene, Eri Mase, Hulana, Haetha, Janiri, Kelthana, Laene Valte, Masani, Neona, Penta Tetha, Savisa 

### Prothean Traits
Your prothean character has certain characteristics in common with all other protheans.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way

__Available Classes__. Adept, Soldier, Vanguard

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

__Age__. Protheans live between 300 and 400 years, reaching adulthood in their early teens.

__Alignment__. Protheans come from a society that was heavily regulated and favored the strong. They are generally lawful neutral.

__Size__. Protheans are slightly taller than humans but generally never taller than 2 meters (6'5"). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 2d10 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__All-seeing Eyes__. Your four eyes can look in multiple directions and have a nascent ability to see cloaked objects. 
You have truesight up to 10m and proficiency in Perception. 


__Quad-Strand DNA__. Your unique quad-strand DNA helps to protect you against radiation and cold. You have radiant and cold damage resistance.


__Psychometry__. While in physical contact with a creature or object, a Prothean can recall its experiences. If you touch an object or
creature and concentrate on it for 1 minute, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object
or creature's point of view, learning of any events that have occurred within 10 meters of the object or creature within
the past 24 hours. If in contact with an object, you see the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long
ago it was last handled. This ability may only be used once per long rest.


### Variant: Awakened Collector

The Collectors are an enigmatic race that live beyond the Omega 4 Relay, a mass relay within the same system as Omega, 
in the Terminus Systems. They are rarely seen in the Terminus itself, let alone Citadel space, and are generally regarded 
as a myth by Citadel citizens. Definite sightings of Collectors have been made on Omega every few centuries.

Collectors are former Protheans that have been completely subjugated by their Reaper masters. Their DNA shows signs of 
"extensive genetic rewrite" including three fewer chromosomes, reduced heterochromatin structure, and the elimination 
of superfluous "junk" sequences.

When the Reaper-killer known as Leviathan fought the Collectors, it severed their connection to Harbinger with a 
thrall device. Most Collector forces died as a result, but a few survived. Now, these rare individuals fight for the 
memory of their people, a proud race broken by the Reapers.

#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an awakened collector, you can choose to replace the _All-Seeing Eyes_, and _Psychometry_
traits with the following.

__Chitinous Exoskeleton__. While not wearing armor, you have +1 AC.

__Forewing Leap__. High and Long jump distances are tripled.

__Seeker Swarm__. As an action, you call 1d4 seeker swarms to a space you can see within 10m. The swarms remain for 
1 hour or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. The swarms are friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
The swarms have their own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn. 
                  
Once you use this feature, you must take a long rest before using it again.

## Quarian

Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the 
seas in search of a new homeland.

### Exotic Fashion
Identifying a quarian is easy. All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from 
foreign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem 
featured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they
were also burdened to life in a suit.

The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen 
without their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their 
suit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.

### Exiles of their Own Creations
Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as "Geth," meaning "Servant of the People". These 
constructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the 
quarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.

The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly
complex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians 
attempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated. 
With many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.

### Migrant Fleet
The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those 
who escaped death by the geth. 


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/f/f5/ME3_Quarian_Marksman.png/revision/latest?cb=20121010043008&format=original' 
  style='width:285px; margin-left: 40px;' />

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/0/0c/Quarian_MP.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415184004&format=original' 
  style='position:absolute; top:50px; right:190px; width:285px; z-index: 1;' />



The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy
strip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their 
own goals but normally return to the fleet.

When young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel 
to ensure genetic diversity of an already small population. 




### Cybernetic Improvements
Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering
and technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended 
from or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally 
small, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to 
those without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device 
is part of their sending off ceremony.

### The Pilgrimage
During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is 
reached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the 
flotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as 
resources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are 
those who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.

### Quarian Names
Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the 
name of their vessel preceeded by a title - "nar" to denote their birth ship and "vas" to denote their post-pilgrimage ship. 
For example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.

## Salarian

Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a 
super-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other races while requiring less rest. 
Additionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly 
tinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.

### Hyperactive Metabolism
The speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The race only requires only one hour of sleep a 
night, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other races. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster. 
They talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has 
advanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.

```
```

<img 
  src='https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e-pdf/blob/master/images/Spacer.gif?raw=true' 
  style='width:1px; margin-top: 300px' />

### Boredom, the Mother of Invention
Salarians minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored. 
Tinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations, 
and possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially 
in electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft he puts his mind to.

### Knowledge is Power
Invention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and 
knowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A 
photographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very 
skilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these 
trades are viable life paths.

### One Mother Among Sons
Salarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According 
to ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male. 
Romantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction. 
As females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political 
power in a complex matriarchal government.

\page


### Matriarchal Feudalism
Salarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her 
daughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory 
known as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble 
matrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian 
is loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.


### Intense Curiosity
Despite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females, 
however, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories, 
though some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and 
pursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new 
lives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.

### Salarian Names
Salarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march, 
duchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless 
necessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.
___
- __Example Full Names__: Rannadril Ghan Swa Fulsoom Karaten Narr Eadi Bel Anoleis, Gorot II Heranon Mal Dinest Got Inoste Ledra
- __Given Names__: Beelo, Chorban, Esheel, Ish, Jarroth, Jarun, Jondum, Kallo, Kirrahe, Maelon, Mordin, Morlan, Padok, Palon, Rentola, Schells, Solik, Tazzik, Tolan, Valern, Zevin
- __Family Names__: Aenarth, Aulaw, Bau, Erkoln, Faergow, Gurji, Heplorn, Inoste, Irheth, Jath, Jowar, Marhall, Raeka, Sernik, Solus, Tann, Vass, Venirn, Vodol, Wiks, Yosann

### Salarian Traits
Your salarian character has certain characteristics in common with all other salarians.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

__Age__. Salarians have an extremely high metabolism that causes a short life span. Salarians rarely reach ages over 40 years of age.

__Alignment__. Salarians can have dubious morals, especially when it comes to experiments and advancing technology. Neutrality is a common alignment for salarians.

__Size__. Salarians are tall with elongated bodies, with a height between 180 and 210 cm (6 to 7 feet), yet a weight below 100 lbs. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10 meters.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 4d12 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Amphibious__. Can breathe both air and water.

__High-Speed Metabolism__. Salarians don't need to sleep for as long as other races. Instead, their unique biology requires that they only need to
sleep for 1 hour a day to gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Because of this, Salarains
only need 4 hours for a long rest.

__Photographic Memory__. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Engineering, Electronics, History, or Science) check to recall information, add
twice your proficiency bonus even if you are not proficient in that skill.

__Twice as Bright__. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice and two tools or kits of your choice.

## Turian

A highly militaristic race, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance 
containing a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian 
race is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with. 
Despite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble race.

### Discipline and Honor
The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal 
responsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own 
personal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs. 
They are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to 
lie about their actions. Because of this, many races attribute to them a "turian honor" seen rarely outside the turian race.

### Proud Warrior Race
At the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years 
and are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for 
authority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their 
service in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve 
the whole by providing public services.

  style='width:325px; margin-top: 80px' />
  
### Hierarchal Meritocracy
Turian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with 
the lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client races and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs 
which lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking 
ones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and 
are given due to assessments from one's superiors.

Despite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe 
on others freedoms or responsibilities.

### Reflective Carapace
The homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic 
carapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however, 
do not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.

### Mission or Desertion
Most Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions. 
Some, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command.
Those who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.

  style='width:150px; margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px' />


### Turian Names
Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include 
their title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name. 
Sometimes turians go by their family name only.

## Volus


The volus are an associate race on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client race of the turians. They 
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry. 

### Mysterious Biology
The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, 
and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen 
air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually 
split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, 
especially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly 
sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider 
the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant. 

### Trade Warriors
The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,
volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has 
made volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. 
Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the 
Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were
responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the "credit" as the standard currency of interstellar
trade.

  style='width:1px; margin-top: 300px' />

Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending
their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,
sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never
spent a cred.

### Council Seat
Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the 
Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need 
to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the 
Krogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, 
none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction
of well-armed dreadnoughts.

### Volus Names
Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family 
name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring. 
___
- __Names__: Ano Vot, Berla Mon, Bovan Set, Ceron, Cihaan, Din Mark, Dovan Hal, Eppo Wen, Han Olar, Jahleed, Jahve Kormat, Kelan Vot, Kora Bos, Lona Osar, Levan Lih, Meeve Wen, Morten Sov, Olot For, Pitne Wit, Reema Po, Tahluud, Vaner Jok

### Volus Traits
Your volus character has certain characteristics in common with all other volus.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

__Age__. Most volus reach adulthood around their 50th year and live to be around 200 years-old.

__Alignment__. Volus society tends towards lawful as a whole, with clans fighting over economic resources and aggressive negotiating, even if they are individually chaotic individuals. They tend towards neutral morality.

__Size__. Volus are between 1 and 1.5 metes (3-4'). Your size is Small.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 8m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Fury of the Small__. When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the
attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

  style='width:325px; position: absolute; bottom: 50px' />


```
```


<span style='padding-left: 12px'></span>__Hermetic Suit__. Your suit is your lifeblood and consists of a reinforced, pressurized body suit and helmet. It makes your immune to 
disease and provides resistance to poison and necrotic damage. 

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your 
suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.

If you are not in an environment made for volus, for each minute in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer 
2d6 poison and 1d6 slashing damage. If you do not repair your suit or get to a volus-appropriate environment within 10 minutes, you die.

__Lucky__. You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one 
luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, 
but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then 
choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to 
influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

__Savvy Dealings__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.

## Vorcha


The vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural 
resources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a 
tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce 
resources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic 
necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which 
preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.

### Non-differentiated cells
The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found 
on the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to 
adapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive 
in high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly 
(~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.

### Clan Violence
Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their 
default form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with 
others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large, 
younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The vorcha are extremely aggressive, both against rivals of 
their own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who have managed to escape their 
homeworld have a tendency to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger spaceships.

### Vorcha Names
Like their lifespans, vorcha names are brutal and short.
___
- __Male names__: Besk, Drent, Dist, Flesk, Grank, Grote, Gryll, Jerst, Kreete, Shisk, Tirst, Tregg,  
- __Female names__: Ast, Brytt, Eesk, Fleeg, Ift, Ish, Keet, Kiv, Pash, Pritt, Shate, Tath  


### Vorcha Traits
Your vorcha shares a number of a traits (mostly agressive) with all other vorcha. They also have an adaptation, based on the 
environment in which they grew up.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way.

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Sentinel, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

__Age__. Vorcha have extremely short lifespans and only live for 20 years. They reach adulthood shortly after their first year.

damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

__Non-Differentiated Cells__. You are immune to disease. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have 
resistance against poison damage

__Limited Regeneration__. You regain all your Hit Dice on a long rest. Additionally, if you lose a body part, the missing part will regrow

- __Arm (to elbow) & Leg (to knee)__: 4 weeks
- __Eye__: 6 weeks
- __Arm (to shoulder) & Leg (to hip)__: 8 weeks

Growing up in a harsh environment, your body evolved so you could survive. Choose one of the following environments:
___
- __Aquatic__: Amphibious. Swim speed 10m.
- __Desert__: Constitution +1. Ignore one level of exhaustion.
- __Frozen__: Resistance to cold damage.
- __High-gravity__: Strength +1.
