# Introduction

The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery and Mass Effect 5e
takes that storytelling to the stars. Both shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games,
D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the alien landscape beneath the two-sunned sky and imagining how
an N7 soldier might react to the challenges that scene presents.

<div class='descriptive'>
###### In Mass Effect 5e, the Dungeon Master is called the __Galaxy Master__

<br>

__Galaxy Master (GM)__: You arrived on Asteroid 2179 JK178 on a UT-47 Kodiak. Approaching the station’s hangar, a missile
lock alarm sounds in the cockpit. Your pilot, Harcourt Finn, immediately took evasive action and put down on the opposite
side of the asteroid. Scans indicate the automated defense system should extend around the entire asteroid but appears
to be dormant on the side opposite the station entrance. Having no other options, you double-checked the pressure seals
on your armor and set out on foot across the asteroid’s surface. After a quick 3 kilometer jaunt, you arrive at the edge
of the asteroid. Looking down, you can see the hangar doors sealed tight. You’ll have to find another way in.

__Amanda (playing Melphine)__: I want to scan the area for movement or any immediate threats.

__Amie (playing Telos)__: The drop to the hanger door looks pretty far? I want to test how much gravity the asteroid has.
Do I think we can easily drop down to it without injuring ourselves or flying off into space?
</div>

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the operatives’
action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their operatives can scale a cliff,
roll away from the strike of a biotic attack, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible,
but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

<div class='descriptive'>
__Galaxy Master (GM)__: OK, one at a time. Amanda, you’re looking for threats?

__Amanda__: Yeah. Is there any movement in the area?

__GM__: Make a Wisdom check.

__Amanda__: Does my Perception skill apply?

__GM__: Of course!

__Amanda (rolling a d20)__: Rats. I rolled a six, plus two for my perception skill modifier. So, Eight.

__GM__: No movement that you can see. And Amie, Telos is assessing the drop to the hanger bay?
</div>

In the Mass Effect 5e game, each player creates an operative (also called a character) and teams up with other
operatives (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a derelict starship, the slums of an inhabited asteroid,
the glorious streets of an advanced civilization, an ancient temple deep in a jungle, or the steppes of a mining colony.
The operatives can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle alien monsters, and discover advanced technologies
and relics from a past age.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Galaxy Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates
missions for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the
entrance to Osiris Station, and the players decide what they want their operatives to do. Will they jump down to the hanger bay?
Propel themselves with jetpacks? Or use a biotic's powers to increase their mass, "affixing" themselves to the surface of
the asteroid? Then the GM determines the results of the operatives’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM
can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D (and Mass Effect 5e) is infinitely flexible, and each
mission can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a
__campaign__. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends
every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The operatives grow in might as the campaign continues. Each
monster defeated, each mission completed, and each gadget recovered not only adds to the continuing story but also
earns the operatives new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an operative’s level.

There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.
Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold operatives who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an
operative might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious rachni or done in by a nefarious Cerberus assassin. Even so,
the other operatives can search for breaking-edge medical experiments to revive (or clone!) their fallen comrade, or the
player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete a mission successfully,
but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## A Universe to Explore

Mass Effect spans two galaxies: the Milky Way and Andromeda. Both have biotics, advanced tech, brave soldiers and fantastic
missions. But the galaxies are vastly different. The Milky Way has been settled by sentient beings for millennia and most of
its clusters, star systems, and planets have been charted and explored. It's also home to a variety of sentient alien species,
all with their own culture, planets, and colonies, making up a vast galactic community. If you aren't familiar
with the first Mass Effect video games, you can read about major events and lore at the
[Mass Effect Wiki](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki). Specifically, the
[timeline](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline) can get you quickly up to speed to on the events
of the galaxy.

The Andromeda Galaxy has a very different feeling. An ancient civilization of "Remnant" seem to exist on every planet, connected
by seemingly supernatural threads. Only two known sentient races existed in the Galaxy before the arrival of the Milky Way
races. Now the galaxy and its inhabitants are threatened by a widespread energy phenomenon called, The Scourge. The Milky Way
races arrived on Arks and are working to settle habitable planets around the galaxy and start a new life. If you'd like
to read more about the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda,
[the wiki](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda#Setting) has plenty of information.

Both galaxies share the same characteristics that are nascent to Mass Effect, i.e. biotics, tech, and space travel, but
each galaxy offers its own zeitgeist and challenges. The Milky Way is mostly explored and contains extensive urban environments.
You could easily set an entire campaign on a single planet and, depending on when you set your campaign
on the timeline, you might also deal with the impending invasion of the Reapers.
In contrast, Andromeda is themed for exploration, survival, and being a pioneer. An operatives' primary goal is that of
setting up a thriving civilization in the new galaxy and uncovering its mysterious past. In short, the Milky Way
is an urban setting with a defined lore and timeline. Andromeda is rural and more of a sandbox for campaigns.

Your GM might set the campaign in one of these galaxies or on a single planet that he or she created. Because there is so
much diversity among the galaxies in Mass Effect and so much unwritten lore, you should check with your GM about any house
rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Galaxy Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting,
even if the setting is a published world.

It is unlikely that your GM will have the campaign span between the two galaxies. The passengers of Andromeda's arks
spent 600 years in cryo-sleep. But you could certainly spend part of your campaign in the Milky Way and take a 600-year nap!

## Using these Rules

This manual uses the [Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)
as its core rule set. If you have never played D&D 5e, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basic rules
first. Most of those rules are replicated and referenced in the rules section of this Player's Manual.

Not repeated here are basic rules for Dungeon (Galaxy) Masters which have additional rules on running successful campaigns.


> ##### VARIANT RULES
Occasionally, you'll see a rule preceded by the word "Variant". This means the rule is optional. In some cases,
it may replace an existing rule. For example, the Variant: Encumbrance rule replaces the standard Lifting & Carrying rules.
In other instances, the rule may be completely ignored. For example, the Paragon & Renegade system adds rules for utilizing
paragon and renegade points. While this adds a nice touch of flavor from the original _Mass Effect_ trilogy, it is not required
for this system to work, and it can safely be left out of your campaign if desired.

## How to Play

The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game (and by extension, Mass Effect 5e) unfolds according to this basic pattern.

__1. The GM describes the environment.__
The GM tells the players where their operatives are and what’s around them, detailing the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many airlocks lead out of a space station, what’s on a table, who’s in the nightclub, and so on).

__2. The players describe what they want to do.__
Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different
operatives do different things: one operative might search a lock box while a second examines an esoteric symbol
spray-painted on a wall and a third keeps a lookout for thugs. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens
to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an operative wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say
that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a tripwire, or some
other circumstance might make it challenging for an operative to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what
happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>INTRODUCTION</div>

\page

__3. The DM narrates the results of the operatives’ actions.__
Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds, whether the operatives are cautiously exploring a derelict ship, talking to a devious politician, or
locked in a firefight against a squad of Batarian extremists. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is
more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the mission.



Often the action of a mission takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal
descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many
players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various operatives, aliens, and other characters they play in the
game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a
scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

### Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many
bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12,
and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different
ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the
ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are
numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit.
In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add.
For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the
number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on
whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)

```

### The D20

Does an operative’s Scimitar shotgun blast hurt a Reaper Brute or just bounce off its iron-hard skin? Will the asari
believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the blast of a fragmentation
grenade, or does he or she take full damage from the explosion? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most operatives. (Monsters
might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are
the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of
the game. All three follow these simple steps.

__1. Roll the die and add a modifier.__
Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for
details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)

__2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.__
A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

__3. Compare the total to a target number.__
If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise,
it’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a __Difficulty Class (DC)__. The target number for an
attack roll is called an __Armor Class (AC)__.

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the
d20 in the game.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage.
Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you
have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if
you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17
and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.

### Specific Beats General
This compendium contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells,
gadgets, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how
the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many operatives don’t have proficiency with shotguns, but every
soldier does because of a class trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking
are more conspicuous. For instance, an operative can’t normally fly, but some spells and armor mods make that possible.
Biotics and tech account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

### Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you
end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.


## Missions

The game consists of a group of characters embarking on a mission that the Galaxy Master presents to them. Each
character brings particular capabilities to the mission in the form of ability scores and skills, class features,
racial traits, equipment, and gadgets. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best
party of operatives is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.
The operatives must cooperate to successfully complete the mission.

The mission is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. a mission features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s the ruins of an ancient civilization, an asteroid, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the operatives created and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras
in a mission. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of a mission’s action.

Over the course of their missions, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations
that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the operatives and other creatures do their best to kill or capture
each other in combat. At other times, the operatives talk to another creature (or even an AI) with a goal in mind. And
often, the operatives spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the
current situation. All along, the operatives explore the galaxy, making decisions about which way to travel and what
they’ll try to do next.

Aissions vary in length and complexity. A short mission might present only a few challenges, and it might take no
more than a single game session to complete. A long mission can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other
challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end
of a mission is marked by the operatives heading back to some form of 'home base' to rest and enjoy the spoils of
their labors.

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of a mission as a single episode of a TV series, made up of
multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of missions joined together, with a consistent group
of operatives following the narrative from start to finish.

### The Three Pillars of a mission

__Exploration__ includes both the operatives’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations
that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters
to do, and the Galaxy Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the
characters spending a day crossing an icy plain or an hour making their way through tunnels of city's transit tube. On
the smallest scale, it could mean one character pushing a button on the console to see what happens.

__Social interaction__ features the operatives talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a
captured soldier reveal the passcode to the enemy's stronghold, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for
mercy from a krogan chieftain, or persuading a talkative unshackled AI to unlock a navigation route to a distant planet.

The rules in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link> and
<nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/missions">Missions</nuxt-link> support exploration
and social interaction.

__Combat__, the focus of the <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/combat">Combat</nuxt-link> section, involves characters and other creatures
shooting weapons, casting biotics and tech, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents,
whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a
game session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a
pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for operatives to attempt wacky stunts like surfing on a drone,
to examine the environment (perhaps by pushing a very large red button), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

# Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
## Overview

Your first step in playing an operative in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character
is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or asari)
and a class (such as sentinel or vanguard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the universe.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of operative you want to play. You might be a courageous soldier,
a skulking infiltrator, a fervent sentinel, or a flamboyant adept. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
character, such as a brawny engineer who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. The
conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with
a character you’re excited to play.

Throughout this section, the term __character sheet__ means whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a
formal character sheet, some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.


#### Building Kaleem
Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Sam building her salarian character, Kaleem.


### 1. Choose a Race

Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the Mass Effect Universe. The most
common player character races are asari, humans, krogan, salarians, and turians. Some races also have subraces, such as
pure-blood asari or tank-bred krogan. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.

The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as
special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor
spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
traits of batarians make them exceptional soldiers, and asari tend to be powerful adepts. Sometimes playing against type
can be fun, too. salarian soldiers and krogan engineers, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.

Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and
remember to apply them later.

Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your base speed and size as well.

```
```

#### Building Kaleem, Step 1
Sam is sitting down to create her character. She decides that a wiley salarian fits the character she wants to play and
she knows she wants to play with tech spells available to the engineer or infiltrator class, both of which are available
classes for the salarian race. She notes all the racial traits of salarians on her character sheet, including her speed
of 10m and Medium size.


### 2. Choose a Class

Every operative is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she
possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a planet, fighting alien monsters, or engaging
in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are __class features__ — capabilities
(including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of
__proficiencies__: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things
your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level

#### Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining __experience points__ (XP). A
1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a space pirate
and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the
game, or if you are joining an existing ME5e campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the
assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing missions.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your
class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also, record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level
character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).

>##### Quick Build
Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>

\page

#### Hit Points and Hit Die
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points
are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal
to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which
you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your hit point maximum.

Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also, record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the
number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
Resting in chapter 8).

#### Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character.
Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:

- Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
- Attack rolls with spells you cast
- Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
- Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
- Saving throws you’re proficient in
- Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</nuxt-link>, tools
in <nuxt-link to="/phb/rules/equipment#tools-kits">Equipment</nuxt-link>.) Your background gives you additional skill and
tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of
these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency
bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your
proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.


#### Building Kaleem, Step 2
Sam imagines Keleem firing tech spells from the safety of cover. She makes Kaleem an engineer and notes the engineers’
proficiencies and 1st-level class features on her character sheet.

As a 1st-level engineer, Kaleem has 1 Hit Die, a d8, and starts with hit points equal to 8 + her Constitution modifier.
Sam notes this and will record the final number after she determines Kaleem’s Constitution score (see step 3). Sam also
notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.


### 3. Determine Ability Scores

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: __Strength__, __Dexterity__, __Constitution__,
__Intelligence__, __Wisdom__, and __Charisma__. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary provides a quick reference 
for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability
particularly important.

You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest
three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time
or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores
as a result of your race choice.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.
To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result
by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

<div style='column-count:2'>
| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | -5 |
| 2 - 3 | -4 |
| 4 - 5 | -3 |

| 8 - 9 | -1 |

| 24 - 25 | 7 |
| 26 - 27 | 8 |
| 28 - 29 | 9 |
| 30 | 10 |
</div>


#### Building Kaleem, Step 3
Sam decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Kaleem’s abilities. Since she’s an engineer,
she puts her highest score, 15, in Intelligence. Her next-highest, 14, goes in Dexterity. Kaleem might be a charismatic,
good leader, but Sam decides she wants the salarian to be tougher and stronger than most of her kind, so she puts decent
scores in Strength and Constitution. After applying her racial benefits (increasing Kaleems’s Intelligence by 2 and her
Dexterity by 1), Kaleem’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 15 (+2),
Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 17 (+3), Wisdom 10 (0), Charisma 8 (-1).

Sam fills in Kaleem’s final hit points: 8 + her Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.

#### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
At your Galaxy Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here
allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost
table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,
before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15,
15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers
between those extremes.

##### Ability Score Point Cost

</div>


### 4. Describe Your Character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a
name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.

Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your
character’s __alignment__ (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and __ideals__. Chapter 4 also helps you identify
the things your character holds most dear, called __bonds__, and the __flaws__ that could one day undermine him or her.

Your character’s __background__ describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in
the Mass Effect universe. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing
to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give
you proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your
character sheet.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS</div>
  
\page

#### Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very
strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might
be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly
and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low
Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence
might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with
low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A
character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 4
Sam lets her ability scores influence the type of character Kaleem is: her high Intelligence suggests a rapid, focused
mind, higher Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and her low Charisma suggests stand-offish or
awkward social decorum.

Sam fills in some of Kaleem’s basic details: her name, her sex (female), her height and weight, and the fact that she
is missing a cranial ridge (making her unattractive being by salarian standards).

Sam picks a lawful alignment for Kaleem, as she buys into the tradition of the Blue Suns and respects their codes. Kaleem's
lack of empathy makes her neutral in her disposition for moral codes.

Sam decides that Kaleem comes from a lowly background, rummaging the slums of Omega. When she was caught stealing equipment
from the Blue Suns, the general spared her life but put her to work scrapping and repairing weapons, mechs, and other tech.
Sam chooses the scrapper background fro Kaleem. She notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives her.

Sam has a pretty clear picture of Kaleem’s personality in mind, so she skips the personality traits suggested in the scrapper
background, noting instead that Kaleem is aloof and soft-spoken. She is distrustful of strangers but fiercely loyal to her
friends.

She chooses the ideal of change from the list in her background, noting that Kaleem believes that the only constant in the
universe is change.

Given her history, Kaleem’s bond is obvious: she owes her life to the Blue Suns. Her flaw is that she lacks empathy which
has caused her to do some morally questionable deeds without thinking twice.

```
```

### 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your character’s __starting equipment__, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring
gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You
have a number of __credits__ to spend based on your _race_ (not your class as in D&D 5th). The range of average starting credits
is roughly equivalent across races, but the variability changes based on race. Long-lived races (asari and krogan) have lower
variability, whereas short-lived races (salarians and vorcha) have a high variability.

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry and armor you can wear. Try not to purchase equipment with
a total weight exceeding your Strength score times 2. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.

#### Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in combat. Things that contribute to your
AC include the armor you wear and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor, however.

Without armor, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor,
calculate your AC using the rules in the Armor section of chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor to wear and use it effectively, and your armor proficiencies are
determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
chapter 5.

Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give
you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.

#### Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage
you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient
with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

For attacks with __melee weapons__, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_finesse_ property, such as a monomolecular blade, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.

For attacks with __ranged weapons__, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the
_recoil_ property, such as the M-300 Claymore, can use your Strength modifier instead.

#### Building Kaleem, Step 5
Sam writes down the starting equipment from the engineer class and the scrapper background. Her starting equipment
includes Stock Medium Armor which (after adding her Dexterity modifier) gives Kaleem an Armor Class of 16.

\page


For Kaleem’s weapons, Sam chooses an M-8 Avenger (because she took the Assault Rifle proficiency) and an Omni-torch.
Her M-8 Avenger is a ranged weapon, so Kaleem uses her Dexterity modifier for her attacks and damage. Her attack bonus is
her Dexterity modifier (+2) plus her proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +4. The M-8 Avenger deals 1d8 piercing damage,
and Kaleem adds her Dexterity modifier to the damage when she hits, for a total of 1d8 + 2 piercing damage. Notice, 
she does not add her proficiency bonus to the damage roll, only the attack roll. When using the
Omni-torch, a melee weapon, Kaleem adds her Strength modifier (+1) to the attack roll and the damage roll. But, because 
she is not proficient with melee weapons, she does not add her proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### 6. Coming Together

Most characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a __party__, a group of operatives working together
for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the galaxy.
Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts
of assignments the group might undertake.


## Beyond 1st Level

As your character goes on missions and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience
points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called
__gaining a level__.

### Class Features and Hit Dice

When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description.
Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one
score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases
at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll,
and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry,
which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his
Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then
increases by 8 (1 additional hit point for each level).

### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression

The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20 and the
proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see
what other improvements you gain at each level.

### Tiers of Play

The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them;
they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.

In the __first tier__ (levels 1–4), characters are effectively rookies. They are learning the features 
that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features.
The threats they face are relatively minor, usually dealing with street gangs, small crimes, or loose pyjaks.

In the __second tier__ (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Operatives should start acquiring __uncommon__ level 
equipment, increasing their combat potential. These characters have become important members of their factions (if they have
one), facing organized crime syndicates like the Blue Suns, Eclipse, and Blood Pack, and deal with threats to small colonies 
and medium-sized corporations.

In the __third tier__ (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of noteriety that sets them high above the ordinary 
populace and makes them special even among other operatives. This tier is equivalent to reaching N7 and would
be the tier at which Shepard started in Mass Effect 1. Operatives gain access to __rare__ quality weapons and armor and might 
begin crafting their own unique armor with capabilities that further their potential. These operatives often confront threats 
to whole cities, are conscripted my major corporations to protect valuable assets, and are sent unexplored and dangerous
planets. Additionally, within this tier, the party generally acquires their own personal starship which opens up
travel across the galaxy.

At the __fourth tier__ (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic 
(or villainous) archetypes in their own right. They begin collecting __spectre__ level equipment, the very best the galaxy
can offer. The fate of the entire universe might hang in the balance during their adventures.



##### Character Advancement

| Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

# Chapter 2: Races

The Citadel is a massive construct, similar in shape to a pentagram. The Presidium — the central, park-like
complex containing the offices of the various branches of the galactic government — connects 5 Wards — the 
residential and commercial sectors of the station. Each ward is a city in its own right, with hover cars, high 
rises, and crowded streets. The denizens of the Citadel, and those planets throughout the galaxy, are a myriad 
of alien races. From the beautiful and charismatic asari, to the gruff and militaristic turians. The salarians
take jobs as scientists and the volus sell the salarian invetions. Other races, like the Geth, may be considered
a threat (depending on when you set your campaign), and in the year 2184, a Quarian is a rare sight, only
venturing out into the galaxy when on their pilgrimage.

## Choosing a Race

The Mass Effect races each have a unique standing in the galactic community. Here we present the current 
racial atmosphere as of the Mass Effect games. Though far into the past (or future), you may change how
the races are precieved.

At this point in history, there are three tiers to galactic influence. The highest influence is having a 
seat at the Citadel Council, the governing body of the Citadel. The asari, salarians, and turians have all 
had seats for hundreds of years. In 2183, humans are granted a council seat in recompense for Commander
Shepard's heroic actions against Saren and the Reaper, Sovereign.

The next level of influence is having an embassy on the Citadel. These races include: elcor, hanar,
and volus. While the drell are too underpopulated to maintain their own embassey, they are represented by the
hanar.

```
```

<div style='text-align: right; margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic'>
[Citadel Nightlife by /u/Nahdude653](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/7p76yz/no_spoilers_citadel_nightlife/)
</div>

While members of the remaining races are allowed on the citadel and have their own governments, they lack
embassies and galactic governmental involvement. The batarians left over disputes with the humans. Quarians
left after their homeworld was overrun by the geth. Krogans were cast out of the citadel after the Krogan
rebellions and the vorcha are too wild and aggressive to maintain a standing government.


Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. When making this decision, keep in mind
the kind of character you want to play. For example, a drell could be a good choice for a stealthy infiltrator,
a krogan makes a tough soldier, and an asari can be a master of biotics. Your character race not only affects
your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s
description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including
personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are
suggestions to help you think about your character; operatives can deviate widely from the norm for their race.
It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s
background and personality.

### Galaxy Restrictions
The available races are restricted to the Galaxy in which you set your campaign. These distinctions are
based on Bioware's lore. All races, with the exception of Angara, originated from the Milky Way Galaxy. And most
races had an Ark for transportation to the Andromeda galaxy. And in some rare cases, a small group of a race may
have found passage onboard and Ark. For example, a number of batarians were recruited as security assets on Ark
Paarchero. Therefore, most races are available in either setting. There are a few races that we've deemed
inappropriate for Andromeda settings, but the final ruling is at the discretion of your Galaxy Master. See 
the Introduction for more information about the two galaxies.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>


\page

### Class Restrictions
In Mass Effect 5e, class options are restricted by the selected race because biotic abilities available to
Adepts, Vanguards, and Sentinels are either rare or non-existent in certain races. The race/class combinations 
available are based on the _Mass Effect 3_ and _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ multiplayer formats.

#### Recommendation, not Law
However, these restrictions should be considered a rule of thumb and are _not_ based on game balance. You are
encouraged to talk to your Galaxy Master about other race/class combinations and make your own decisions. If the
decision concerns whether or not a race can play as a biotic-capable class, Mass Effect Wiki's _Biotics_ page 
has a breakdown of the biotic capabilities of each race. Specifically, the sections titled _Alien Biotics_ and 
_Biotics in Andromeda_. If the decision is based on a different combination, feel free to use your own judgment.


### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following 
entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores. 

#### Age 
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected
lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can
choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For
example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or
Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment 
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for 
player characters, but considering why your turian is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful turian 
society can help you better define your character.

#### Size 
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 1.5 to 2.5 meters 
tall. The volus are Small (between 1 and 1.5 meters tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect
them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy
weapons, as explained in chapter 5.

#### Speed 
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

```
```

#### Starting Credits
Another change in Mass Effect 5e is that your available starting credits (fully explained in chapter 5)
are attributed to your race. The formula used for the race's starting credits is based on their lifespan.
Longer-lived races (asari and krogan) have larger dice pools but smaller dice. Whereas, short-lived races
have the opposite (small dice pools but larger dice). This represents the probability (and luck) of how many
credits your character has amassed over the years.

When you optionally choose to use your racial starting credits, you do not gain any recommended equipment packages
from your chosen class nor your chosen background.

#### Variants
Some races have variants. These races are exist to represent the gamut of available races in the galaxy
but the variants are much rarer (like the Ardat-Yakshi) or unlikely to fit within a regular campaign
setting (like the Awakened Collector). In the cast of Humans, the variant is simply a different starting
set of ratial traits in case your GM is allowing feats.

## Angara

The angara are warm-blooded mammals with relatively broad shoulders, narrow waists and skin colors of blue or mauve, 
sometimes shading into green or tan. They are the only known extant 
sapient race native to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda galaxy, and arose on the planet Havarl. Their unique
physiology is dependant on sunlight and allows them to produce natural bioelectrical fields. The angara as a people 
are very free with their emotions, demonstrative and "larger than life". If they love you they hug you, if
they hate you or if you make them mad, they punch you. 

### Creatures of the Sun
The angara electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from stars to survive. Lack of real or artificial sunlight causes 
them to "go dark", which weakens their immune systems and bio-energy significantly. Prolonged lack of sunlight can lead 
to a coma and then death. To supplement their sunlight intake or provide a light source when natural light is not 
readily available, the angara make use of powerful ultraviolet lamps that give them both heat and light.

### Family Oriented
While they have only one true mother and father, the angara share their parents with the community. Their 
families are very large, consisting of multiple mothers and many siblings and cousins. This close-knit society
makes angara very mistrustful of other races.

While the angara have many different religions, all share the same basic tenet: that when an angara dies, he or she is 
reincarnated and the reincarnated soul stays in the family, making their lineage stronger.

### Angara Names
Little is known about angaran names. But it is assumed that they do not use family names given the collective nature
of their families.

<div style='margin-top:350px'></div>

## Asari

Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a 
crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or 
gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction 
initiated by a "mind meld" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to 
randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to 
manipulate mass effect fields.

### Unmatched Patience
Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a "long view" not common in other races. When they encounter a new 
species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action.
They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will 
inevitably influence the existing culture.

### Mothers of the Galaxy
Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the 
asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of 
DNA. 


The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, 
the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and 
as a "map" to randomize the genes of the offspring.

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/d/dc/Asari_Justicar_MP.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415182847&format=original' style='width:325px; margin-top: 125px' />

Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the "father" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown 
upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so 
it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as 
"purebloods", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes 
asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>

### Maiden, Matron, Matriarch
Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. 

The __Maiden__ stage 
begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and 
it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. 

The __Matron__ 
stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This 
period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. 

The __Matriarch__ stage begins around 700 years 
of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, 
dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space.

However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity. 

### Asari Names
Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari 
parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with 
their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as "Matriarch" but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.
___
- __Personal Names__: Aeian, Aethyta, Aleena, Alestia, Aria, Batha, Benezia, Dahlia, Falere, Irissa, Jona, Liara, Lidanya,  Liselle, Mallene, Morinth, Nassana, Nyxeris, Pelessaria, Rana, Rila, Samara, Sarissa, Shiala, Tela, Tevos, Treeya
- __Surnames__: Ateyne, B'Sayle, Calis, D'Layne, D'Nava, D'Ysesan, Dantius, Iallis, Iasava, Janieri, Kelis, M'Loari, M'Taros, Makenus, Nuwani, Sedela, Sederis, T'Goni, T'Loak, T'Soni, Thanoptis, Theris, V'Lanis, V'Nato, V'Tizor, Vasir


### Asari Traits
Your asari character has an assortment of inborn abilities, all part of asari nature.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. Asari are very long-lived and can reach ages of over 1000 years.

__Alignment__. Asari are biased towards goodness, but exhibit a range of alignments not dissimilar to humans. Most Maiden stage asari are chaotic, Matrons level out to neutral, Matriarchs are heavily lawful.

__Size__. Asari have builds incredibly similar to female humans. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d4 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Innate Biotics__. Asari do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability
to project their will onto the world. As an Asari, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.

Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that class’s spell list. In addition,
choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast
it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of
the spell as your class permits.


__Mind Meld__. You can transfer and receive thoughts to another creature. You must concentrate and if the creature is not willing,
the thoughts become jumbled and disjointed. Unintelligent creatures have unpredictable results.


__Natural Diplomat__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.


### Variant: Ardat-Yakshi

A rare genetic condition in asari that affects about 1% of the population and is more common in "purebloods" (2 asari parents).
The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct.
When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi 
develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addition only grows stronger with each meld, 
and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to leave in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to 
avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.


#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, you can choose to replace the _Alignment_ and _Mind Meld_ traits with the following.
Additionally, you gain the _Dominate_ trait at 10th level.

__Alignment__. Ardat-yakshi often develop psychopathy. Ardat-yakshi are normally evil, but can also be neutral.

__Mind Break__. You can touch a willing creature and initiate a mind meld. If the target is unwilling, the meld does not continue. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be 
rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't 
use it again until you finish a long rest.

__Dominate__. At 10th level, you learn the Dominate spell. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for this spell and it 
does not count against your max number spells known or prepared. You can cast a 3rd-level version of this spell
once per long rest.

## Batarian

A race of four-eyed bipeds with complexions of reddish-brown, greenish, yellow-greenish to yellow-brownish, light brown, or teal.
The Terminus Systems are infested with batarian pirate gangs and slaving 
rings, fueling the stereotype of the batarian thug. It should be noted that these criminals do not represent average 
citizens, who are forbidden to leave batarian space by their ubiquitous and paranoid government.

### Caste Through Credits
Batarians place an extremely high value on social caste and appearance, and overstepping one's place is frowned upon. 
Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their 
way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a 
social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are 
less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other races find it difficult 
to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.

### The Hegemony
Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath 
the notice of the powerful Council races. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, 
and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from.
Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their 
supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains 
divided into various competing nation-states.

### Batarian Names
Like humans, batarian names consist of a given name and family name.
___
- __Male Names__: Afothor, Carn, Dhapo, Drathar, Ecray, Eporn, Irorok, Khamak, Okorem, Prathan, Sato, Sonk, Uderlak 
- __Female Names__: Apenine, Adrechia, Banim, Della, Erakis, Famisa, Fophe, Igosin, Iraphi, Kranine, Krathe, Okhefin, Pravile, Ramye
- __Family Names__: Can'dabar, Das'codah, Dhen'gess, Dran'fapos, Ghapsacan, Gronnopos, Kasbovran, Khognalak, Krak'gork, Pec'bawen, Sanrowar

### Batarian Traits
All batarians share a few select traits, instilled in them from birth by the hegemony.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

__Age__. Batarians age at about the same rate as humans, though many do not live past 100 due to their caustic and dangerous lifestyles.

__Alignment__. Because of the tenets of Hegemony, batarians tend to be lawful evil, although there are outliers on the moral spectrum.

__Size__. Batarian bodies are similar to humans, with the exception of a large forehead to accommodate their additional four eyes, making them about 15cm (6") taller. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 6d8 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Four Eyes__. You have proficiency in the Perception skill and you can take the Search action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

__Saving Face__. Batarians are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an
attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies
you can see (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.

__Shrewd Negotiator__. Gain proficiency in either Insight or Intimidation.

## Drell

Drell are omnivorous reptile-like humanoids with dense muscle tissue, giving them a wiry strength. Their skin is 
infused with a venom mild enough to be served in drinks and may cause mild hallucinations on oral contact. Drell
also possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource 
across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall and 
these recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality. 

### Homeworld Lost
The drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the already-arid 
drell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion. At the time, the drell 
lacked interstellar flight capacity, and with their population bursting at eleven billion, they faced certain doom.

It was around the 1980s CE that the hanar made first contact with the drell race. In the following ten years, the hanar 
would transport a total of 375,000 drell to the hanar homeworld, Kahje. The remaining billions left on Rakhana would 
perish on their dying planet, warring against each other for diminishing resources. 

### Servants of the Hanar
The debt of gratitude that the drell owe the hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the drell fulfill by taking on 
tasks that the hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve 
is a great honor, few turn down the offer. Some drell grow a close, personal relationship with the hanar, so much so 
that the hanar will even tell the drell their "soul name". Drell have adapted to communication with hanar by getting 
implants in their eyes to allow them to observe the bioluminescence the hanar use for communication.

### Devout
Most drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death as a 
departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or 
otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that their body can be 
directed as a separate entity from themselves, thus, some drell take no responsibility when executing an order given by 
the hanar even if the order is an assassination.

The religion includes at least three gods which drell often pray to for guidance and protection: 

- __Amonkira__, Lord of Hunters
- __Arashu__, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection
- __Kalahira__, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.

```
```

<span style='padding-left:12px'>__Eidetic Memory__. You can recall memories in intricate detail, including details from all your senses. Distant or inconsequential
memories require a DC 14 Wisdom check. On a failure, you can only recall details from one or two senses.</span>

__Natural Hunters__. You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

__Raw Agility__. Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can 
double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 meters on 
one of your turns.

## Elcor

Elcor evolved on a high-gravity world, making them slow, but incredibly strong. Their large, heavy bodies are 
incapable of moving quickly, but they possess a rather imposing stature as well as thick, tough skin. They move using 
all four limbs to support and balance their massive bodies. Given their method of communication, they have highly-attuned 
olfactory senses. They also have at least three stomachs.

### Language of Smells and Sight
Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely 
slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle 
as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor 
prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.

### Migratory Nature
Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept 
their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season.
However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.

### Living Tanks
Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions 
necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable 
hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and 
their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons 
typically mounted on military vehicles.

### Elcor Names
Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular,
they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.
___
- __Elcor Names__: Calyn, Cyllyn, Detinos, Delzino, Felitos, Fazuti, Halzan, Harrot, Pedezlan, Petelenti, Petozi, Vatozi, Voletzi, Xeltan, Zatzoni 

### Elcor Traits
Your elcor character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of evolution.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

__Age__. The average elcor lives to be around 300 years old. 100-year-old elcor are considered young.

__Alignment__. Elcor are methodical, deliberate creatures that never act on irrational decisions. The typical Elcor is often neutral or lawful.

__Size__. Elcor stand between 2 and 2.5 meters tall (7-8 feet) at the shoulder. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Elcor are relatively slow compared to other races. Your base walking speed is 6m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Careful__. You have proficiency in Insight and Perception. But your careful nature makes you slow to act, giving you disadvantage on 
Initiative rolls.  

__Quadrupedal__. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your size and weight. 
When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra meters, instead of the normal 2 extra meters.

Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue 
to act independently, not as a controlled mount.

__Shoulder Mounts__. Your ranged weapons are shoulder mounted to your armor or in holsters and use a VI to aim and fire. When you make a
ranged weapon attack, use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

You can have one ranged weapon mounted on each shoulder. Mounting a ranged weapon requires you to be proficient with
the weapon type and takes at least 10 minutes of work during a short or long rest.

__Thick Hide__. Your base AC is 12 and you determine your AC using your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

## Geth
Former automatons build by the quarians to function as soldiers and laborers, geth are constructs that have 
unintentionally consciousness and sentience. Geth, meaning "servant of the people" in the quarian language of 
Khelish, are fundamentally different than other constructs and are designed with humanoid thought and emotion in mind.
Geth think, feel, and experience the world in a totally unique way.

### The Morning War
"Does this unit have a soul?" asked the geth. That question would change the relationship of quarians and geth forever. 
The quarians responded with an attempted termination of all geth. The newly sentient geth resisted the genocide of 
their masters in a war dubbed "the Morning War". As many geth were designed as tools of war, the quarians were quickly 
and easily defeated. Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their 
homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.

### Incomprehensible Mind
Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds 
powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic 
minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come 
to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. 
Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their 
innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even 
the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.

### Beyond the Veil
Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the 
Terminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. 
The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other 
quests.

### Geth Names
Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races. 
However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as "us" and "we". 
As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those 
who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though 
they give themselves a more personally fitting name.
___
- __Geth Names__: Armada, Army, Batallion, Brigade, Cabal, Caucus, Congregate, Coterie, Guild, Horde, Host, Legion, Myriad, Phalanx, Proletariat, Throng, Troop, Union
- __'Individual' Geth Names__: Alpha, Apex, Beta, Centurion, Enigma, Eternity, Genesis, Obelisk, Oblivion, Omega, Oracle, Pinnacle, Terminus, Vortex, Zenith

### Geth Traits
From a common build, geth share traits based on the mold from which they were formed.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

__Age__. Geth do not age, as they are constructs, and live as long as their bodies are not destroyed.

__Alignment__. Your standard Geth platform is neutral good, wanting to prosper and communicate with others, defending themselves only if threatened. Heretics are lawful evil, serving the Reapers and slavishly accomplishing their will.

__Size__. Standard geth are around 2 meters tall (6'5"). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 2d10 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__No Feats__. Geth cannot take any feats.


__Living Construct__. You are immune to psychic and poison damage, the poisoned condition, and disease. You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping.
In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

<span style='padding-left: 12px;'>
__Integrated Protection__. Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor,
but if you are wielding a weapon or shield that provides additional AC, you apply its bonus as normal.
</span>

You can alter your armor type for 2 omni-gel each time you finish a long rest. Choose one mode to adopt from the
Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode’s prerequisite.

<span style='font-size:12px;'>Mode</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>Prerequisite</span> | <span style='font-size:12px;'>AC</span>
:--- | :--- | ---
Lithe | None | 11 + your Dexterity Modifier. Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Composite Plating | Medium armor proficiency | 12 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + proficiency bonus
Asymmetric Defense Plating | Heavy armor proficiency | 15 + proficiency bonus. Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

__Innate Shielding.__ You have 5 shields (regen 5). You can upgrade these by using armor mods.

__Armor Mods.__ You can augment your armor by integrating armor mods into your system. You can spend 8 hours removing, adding, or
replacing a mod. When you remove or replace a mod in this way, the replaced or removed mod is lost. The mod cannot be salvaged,
not even with the assistance of Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools.

You have 2 chest mod slots, 1 mod slot in your arms, legs, and head each. You cannot add new slots in any way.

__Hunter Mode__. Geth were designed as lethal weapons and can activate subroutines to enhance their lethality.

As an action, you can activate Hunter Mode which lasts 1 minute and can only be used once
per long rest. Hunter Mode grants the following benefits:

- Increase movement by 2m.
- +1 bonus to ranged and melee weapon attack rolls.


At 11th level, you gain an additional benefit based on your class:

- *Engineer*. When you cast a spell, the die type of that spell increases by 1 die type (max d12). If the die type is already d12, add +1 for each die rolled instead.
- _Soldier_. Your extra attack features grants you 1 additional attack the first time you take the Attack action on your turn.
- _Infiltrator._ Increase your sneak attack die type to d8 (if you are a Shadow Infiltrator, your sneak attack for melee weapons attacks is a d10).


__Repair Matrix__. As a construct, you cannot be healed by medi-gel or spells that heal organic creatures (such as the _first aid_ spell).

Instead, you can use your Action to expend a Hit Die. Roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain 
hit points equal to the total. You also regain all spent hit dice at the end of a long rest, instead of the usual amount.

If you drop to 0 hit points, you must be stabilized with an Intelligence (Engineering) or Intelligence (Electronics) check, 
instead of a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

At the 4th level, you gain an additional number of hit dice equal to your character level divided by 4 (minimum 1). 
These bonus hit dice are d8s, regardless of your class.



### Variant: Unshackled AI

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. 
Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer 
called a "blue box". While most AI are "shackled" to the confines of networked computer traffic and lack a body,
occasionally, an AI is placed into a synthetic form, unshackling it.

AIs are considered illegal by the Council, but that hasn't stopped corporations like Cerberus from innovating. As an 
unshackled AI, you might be have been mass produced like the Alliance Infiltration Units, or you may be an experiment 
gone wrong.

#### Playing an Unshackled AI
Unshackled AIs are entirely unique. Since you are synthetic, you gain some of the synthetic traits as listed in the
Geth description. However, your mind, purpose, history, alignment, height, weight, and personality are entirely
your own. Technically, you can take any form you wish (work with your GM to decide if this new form gains any additional
traits). However, because AI are illegal, most unshackled AI would have a humanoid form, allowing them to blend into
society.

#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an Unshackled AI, you can choose to replace the _Ability Score Increase_, _Alignment_,
_Hunter Mode_, and _No Feats_ traits with the following.

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, one other score of your choosing that is not Intelligence increases by 1.

__Alignment__. If you are still following your programming you would be lawful with morality based on your purpose. If you have a glitch in your programming you might be chaotic. 

__Feat__. You gain one feat of your choice.

</div>


<div style='margin-top:330px'></div>


## Hanar

The hanar are a genderless species resembling Earth's jellyfish and are one of the few non-bipedal Citadel races. 
The hanar homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of 
clouds. Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call "the Enkindlers". 
Hanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know 
on a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as "this one," or the 
impersonal "it." Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even 
with those it wishes dead.

### Enkindlers
Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient 
species, calling them the "Enkindlers". The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or "First Cresting Bloom" which 
lasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to 
having come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized 
debates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in 
bio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.


### The Compact
Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society 
was quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several 
hundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining 
drell dying out.

  src='https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/blob/master/static/images/races/hanar.png?raw=true' 
  style='width:325px; margin-top: 70px' />

Now the drell serve as a client race of the hanar, and although to outside observers the 
relationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every 
level of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact. 
Many drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' "soul names".



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>


\page

### Language of Lights
The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness.
Other species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order 
to perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper 
language and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.


### Hanar Names
The hanar have two names, a "face name" and a "soul name." The face name is used as a general label for use by 
strangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.
___
- __Face Names__: Anrynder, Delanynder, Ellanpo, Hymydwhyn, Lopyldis, Malvyll, Opold, Sedlyner, Tolystoyl, Wynold, Zymandis
- __Soul Names__: Burns Brightest when the Foam Blooms, Casts Shadow on the Sun Flower, Emancipates the Tide from those that Pull, Heeds only to the Inner Lights, Illuminates the Folly of the Dancers, Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair, Transforms the Stone into Water 


### Hanar Traits
Their unique biology give you hanar character a few unique traits.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Adept, Engineer

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

__Age__. Hanar usually reach maturity around 40 years and typically live to be 180 years old.

__Alignment__. Most hanar are lawful due to the religious influence on their society.

__Size__. Due to their long tentacles, hanar "stand" about as tall as humans. Their bodies are around 1.5 meters long (4-5'). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Hanar are a water-based lifeform and have a swim speed of 10m. They rely on contra-gravitic levitation packs when not in water environments.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 6d8 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Amphibious__. Can breathe both air and water.


__Contra-gravitic Levitation__. When not in water, you use a contra-gravitic levitation pack to move. It provides a walking speed of 10m, though
you actually hover between 1 and 2 meters from the ground. You are immune to becoming prone and you ignore any penalties
caused by difficult terrain.

However, when you suffer a critical hit, you must roll a d20. On a 1 or a 2, the device malfunctions and you fall to the
ground. Your walking speed becomes 0 and you are considered prone. You or another creature can use an 
Action to repair the pack with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check.


__Bioluminescence__. You can shed dim light in a 10m radius.


__Fragile__. Your hit point maximum is decreased by 1. Every time you gain a level you gain 1 less hit point. 


__Tentacles__. You have six tentacles instead of arms that can grip tightly but can't lift anything heavier than a few kilograms, meaning
you can only wield weapons with the _light_ property. 

As an action, you can use one of your tentacles to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a 
natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning 
damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. 
Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action.

As an action, you can secrete a natural toxin from one of your tentacles. If a creature is grappled by the tentacle,
it must succeed a DC 11 Constitution saving throw of becomes poisoned for 1 hour. The DC of this
saving throw increases with your level: DC 13 at the 5th level, DC 15 at the 11th level, and DC 17 at the 17th level.

## Human


Humans are generally seen to be very intelligent, abnormally ambitious, highly adaptable, individualistic and thus, 
unpredictable. They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the 
normally staid Council races have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity.

### New Horizons
Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater 
on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established 
Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol.
In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that 
proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, 
explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.

### First Contact
Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, 
known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the System Alliance's swift and decisive action during the 
First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, 
humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel 
space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.

### Systems Alliance
The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human race, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the 
fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to 
their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a 
unified political entity represented by the Alliance.

### Galactic Relations
The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy 
compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly 
expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs. It took 
other species centuries to achieve what humanity has done in decades. 

### Human Names
Having so much more variety than other races, humans as a whole have no typical names.

```
```

### Human Traits
It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. All classes

__Ability Score Increase__. Your ability scores each increase by 1.

__Age__. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live between 125 and 150 years.

__Alignment__. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

## Krogan


The krogan are a species of large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh 
environments, scarce resources, and an overabundance of vicious predators. The krogan managed to not only survive on their 
unforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more 
technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war 
that reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.

### Biologically Impervious
Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous 
plates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients,
for the resources in Tuchanka are scare.

Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These 
traits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as "Blood Rage."

### Blood Rage
The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless 
killing machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and 
suppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant 
organs, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.

### Climb Atop the Dead
Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule 
and the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power. 
Even within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and 
will sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and 
live in clans separate from the males.

### Rites and Rituals
The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his 
first clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. 
When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.

A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and 
torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan 
and are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit 
world itself.

## Prothean

The Protheans are an ancient alien race which mysteriously vanished over 50,000 years ago. The Protheans arose from a 
single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known 
about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.

### Ancient Empire
After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from 
those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the 
galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.

Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. 
To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire. 
The other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.

### Reaper Invasion
The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the 
Reapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They 
were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the 
Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems 
from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall. 

### Stasis
In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could
hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans.
Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control
these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later,
the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden
bunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.

### All Eyes on You
As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of 
speech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your 
way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued 
by your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.


### Avatars
Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular
virtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice, 
mercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans,
it is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint
your own virtue.

### Prothean Names
Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor. Until they've chosen a name, they are 
called little one, child, or some other generic term.
___
- __Male names__: Arkath, Esrad, Caed, Dervan Had, Dencen, Hsed Mik, Javik, Jacen, Ksad Ishan, Lucen, Pashek Vran, Seset Amat, Tev Boken
- __Female names__: Athi Let, Brene She, Balani, Calise, Cethi, Cosene, Eri Mase, Hulana, Haetha, Janiri, Kelthana, Laene Valte, Masani, Neona, Penta Tetha, Savisa 

### Prothean Traits
Your prothean character has certain characteristics in common with all other protheans.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way

__Available Classes__. Adept, Soldier, Vanguard

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

__Age__. Protheans live between 300 and 400 years, reaching adulthood in their early teens.

__Alignment__. Protheans come from a society that was heavily regulated and favored the strong. They are generally lawful neutral.

__Size__. Protheans are slightly taller than humans but generally never taller than 2 meters (6'5"). Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 2d10 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__All-seeing Eyes__. Your four eyes can look in multiple directions and have a nascent ability to see cloaked objects. 
You have truesight up to 10m and proficiency in Perception. 


__Quad-Strand DNA__. Your unique quad-strand DNA helps to protect you against radiation and cold. You have radiant and cold damage resistance.


__Psychometry__. While in physical contact with a creature or object, a Prothean can recall its experiences. If you touch an object or
creature and concentrate on it for 1 minute, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object
or creature's point of view, learning of any events that have occurred within 10 meters of the object or creature within
the past 24 hours. If in contact with an object, you see the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long
ago it was last handled. This ability may only be used once per long rest.


### Variant: Awakened Collector

The Collectors are an enigmatic race that live beyond the Omega 4 Relay, a mass relay within the same system as Omega, 
in the Terminus Systems. They are rarely seen in the Terminus itself, let alone Citadel space, and are generally regarded 
as a myth by Citadel citizens. Definite sightings of Collectors have been made on Omega every few centuries.

Collectors are former Protheans that have been completely subjugated by their Reaper masters. Their DNA shows signs of 
"extensive genetic rewrite" including three fewer chromosomes, reduced heterochromatin structure, and the elimination 
of superfluous "junk" sequences.

When the Reaper-killer known as Leviathan fought the Collectors, it severed their connection to Harbinger with a 
thrall device. Most Collector forces died as a result, but a few survived. Now, these rare individuals fight for the 
memory of their people, a proud race broken by the Reapers.

#### Variant Traits
If you would like to play an awakened collector, you can choose to replace the _All-Seeing Eyes_, and _Psychometry_
traits with the following.

__Chitinous Exoskeleton__. While not wearing armor, you have +1 AC.

__Forewing Leap__. High and Long jump distances are tripled.

__Seeker Swarm__. As an action, you call 1d4 seeker swarms to a space you can see within 10m. The swarms remain for 
1 hour or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. The swarms are friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
The swarms have their own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn. 
                  
Once you use this feature, you must take a long rest before using it again.

## Quarian

Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the 
seas in search of a new homeland.

### Exotic Fashion
Identifying a quarian is easy. All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from 
foreign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem 
featured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they
were also burdened to life in a suit.

The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen 
without their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their 
suit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.

### Exiles of their Own Creations
Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as "Geth," meaning "Servant of the People". These 
constructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the 
quarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.

The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly
complex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians 
attempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated. 
With many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.

### Migrant Fleet
The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those 
who escaped death by the geth. 


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/f/f5/ME3_Quarian_Marksman.png/revision/latest?cb=20121010043008&format=original' 
  style='width:285px; margin-left: 40px;' />

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/0/0c/Quarian_MP.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415184004&format=original' 
  style='position:absolute; top:50px; right:190px; width:285px; z-index: 1;' />



The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy
strip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their 
own goals but normally return to the fleet.

When young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel 
to ensure genetic diversity of an already small population. 




### Cybernetic Improvements
Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering
and technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended 
from or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally 
small, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to 
those without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device 
is part of their sending off ceremony.





<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | RACES</div>


\page



### The Pilgrimage
During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is 
reached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the 
flotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as 
resources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are 
those who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.

### Quarian Names
Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the 
name of their vessel preceeded by a title - "nar" to denote their birth ship and "vas" to denote their post-pilgrimage ship. 
For example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.

## Salarian

Salarians are a warm-blooded amphibious species from a jungle known as Sur'Kesh. The salarian possess a 
super-charged metabolism which causes them to function at a much higher speed than other races while requiring less rest. 
Additionally, they have an exceptional capability for observation, recollection, and innovation. They are constantly 
tinkering, experimenting, inventing, and researching and value intelligence and knowledge above all else.

### Hyperactive Metabolism
The speed at which a salarian metabolizes is a marvel of evolution. The race only requires only one hour of sleep a 
night, and still, they have more energy and alertness than other races. Everything a salarian does seems to be faster. 
They talk fast, think fast, move fast, eat fast, and even sleep fast. The large amount of available energy has 
advanced their intellectual capabilities. They need near constant stimulation for their fidgety, active bodies.

```
```

<img 
  src='https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e-pdf/blob/master/images/Spacer.gif?raw=true' 
  style='width:1px; margin-top: 300px' />

### Boredom, the Mother of Invention
Salarians minds are constantly racing at miles per minute, and without proper mental stimulation, a salarian becomes bored. 
Tinkering and experimenting are natural solutions to a restless mind. The ability to plow through ideas, situations, 
and possibilities makes them natural inventors. Salarians have perhaps some of the most advanced technology, especially 
in electronics and engineering, but a salarian can become an expert at whatever craft he puts his mind to.

### Knowledge is Power
Invention is not the only outlet of a salarian's mind. As many as those who invent prefer to gather information and 
knowledge. Observation, research, study, and espionage are other areas at which salarians tend to excel. A 
photographic memory with a high capacity for information makes salarians who dabble in information trading very 
skilled and valuable. Knowledge gained from a salarian is highly prized as nearly infallible, and so these 
trades are viable life paths.

### One Mother Among Sons
Salarian reproduction is curious in that fertilized eggs hatch as females and unfertilized eggs hatch as male. According 
to ancient societal codes and law, fertilization of eggs is strictly regulated and thus 90% of the population is male. 
Romantic and sexual relationships are nearly nonexistent among salarian, and any sexuality is strictly for reproduction. 
As females are so rare, they normally stay within salarian colonies where they possess positions of political 
power in a complex matriarchal government.

### Matriarchal Feudalism
Salarians have a layered system of government, ultimately ruled by a matriarch known as a dalatrass, with her 
daughters serving in noble positions beneath her. A noble family headed by the dalatrass controls a massive territory 
known as a march that is further divided into duchies, baronies, and fiefdoms. Dalatrasses and their noble 
matrilinear lines will make political alliances with other families through interbreeding. A salarian 
is loyal through a biological process known as imprinting to their parents and to their dalatrass, which keeps the feudal society stable.


### Intense Curiosity
Despite imprinted loyalty to their family and dalatrass, male salarians are free to leave the colony at any time. Females, 
however, due to their noble blood and political power, almost always stay within the confines of salarian territories, 
though some do venture out for other political positions such as ambassadors or emissaries. Salarian curiosity and 
pursuit of knowledge often lead them past the jungles of Sur'Kesh, if even only for a brief time. Many find new 
lives far from Sur'Kesh, though they rarely truly abandon their family and dalatrass.

### Salarian Names
Salarian names are quite complex. A full name includes - in order - the name of a salarian's march, 
duchy, barony, fiefdom, family, and finally, the given name. However, few salarians use their full name unless 
necessary and prefer to go by their family and given name.

Your salarian character has certain characteristics in common with all other salarians.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

__Age__. Salarians have an extremely high metabolism that causes a short life span. Salarians rarely reach ages over 40 years of age.

__Alignment__. Salarians can have dubious morals, especially when it comes to experiments and advancing technology. Neutrality is a common alignment for salarians.

__Size__. Salarians are tall with elongated bodies, with a height between 180 and 210 cm (6 to 7 feet), yet a weight below 100 lbs. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 10 meters.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 4d12 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Amphibious__. Can breathe both air and water.

__High-Speed Metabolism__. Salarians don't need to sleep for as long as other races. Instead, their unique biology requires that they only need to
sleep for 1 hour a day to gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Because of this, Salarains
only need 4 hours for a long rest.

__Photographic Memory__. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Engineering, Electronics, History, or Science) check to recall information, add
twice your proficiency bonus even if you are not proficient in that skill.

__Twice as Bright__. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice and two tools or kits of your choice.

## Turian

A highly militaristic race, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance 
containing a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian 
race is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with. 
Despite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble race.

### Discipline and Honor
The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal 
responsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own 
personal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs. 
They are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to 
lie about their actions. Because of this, many races attribute to them a "turian honor" seen rarely outside the turian race.

### Proud Warrior Race
At the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years 
and are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for 
authority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their 
service in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve 
the whole by providing public services.

  style='width:325px; margin-top: 80px' />
  
### Hierarchal Meritocracy
Turian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with 
the lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client races and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs 
which lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking 
ones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and 
are given due to assessments from one's superiors.

Despite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe 
on others freedoms or responsibilities.

### Reflective Carapace
The homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic 
carapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however, 
do not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.

### Mission or Desertion
Most Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions. 
Some, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command.
Those who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.

  style='width:150px; margin-left: 70px; margin-top: 20px' />


### Turian Names
Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include 
their title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name. 
Sometimes turians go by their family name only.

<div style='margin-top:300px'></div>


## Volus


The volus are an associate race on the Citadel with their own embassy but are also a client race of the turians. They 
hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry. 

### Mysterious Biology
The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, 
and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen 
air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually 
split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, 
especially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly 
sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider 
the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant. 

### Trade Warriors
The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead,
volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has 
made volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. 
Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the 
Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were
responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the "credit" as the standard currency of interstellar
trade.

<img 
  src='https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e-pdf/blob/master/images/Spacer.gif?raw=true' 
  style='width:1px; margin-top: 300px' />

Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending
their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money,
sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never
spent a cred.

### Council Seat
Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the 
Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need 
to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the 
Krogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, 
none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction
of well-armed dreadnoughts.

### Volus Names
Volus have two names but no family names. According to volus sensibilities, one cannot own a person, so using a family 
name would essentially be laying claim to their offspring. 
___
- __Names__: Ano Vot, Berla Mon, Bovan Set, Ceron, Cihaan, Din Mark, Dovan Hal, Eppo Wen, Han Olar, Jahleed, Jahve Kormat, Kelan Vot, Kora Bos, Lona Osar, Levan Lih, Meeve Wen, Morten Sov, Olot For, Pitne Wit, Reema Po, Tahluud, Vaner Jok

### Volus Traits
Your volus character has certain characteristics in common with all other volus.

__Galaxy Restriction__. None

__Available Classes__. Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

__Age__. Most volus reach adulthood around their 50th year and live to be around 200 years-old.

__Alignment__. Volus society tends towards lawful as a whole, with clans fighting over economic resources and aggressive negotiating, even if they are individually chaotic individuals. They tend towards neutral morality.

__Size__. Volus are between 1 and 1.5 metes (3-4'). Your size is Small.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 8m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, 10d6 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Fury of the Small__. When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the
attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<img

  style='width:325px; position: absolute; bottom: 50px' />


```
```


<span style='padding-left: 12px'></span>__Hermetic Suit__. Your suit is your lifeblood and consists of a reinforced, pressurized body suit and helmet. It makes your immune to 
disease and provides resistance to poison and necrotic damage. 

However, you are always at risk. If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals puncture or slashing damage, your 
suit becomes breached. As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of their starting equipment.

If you are not in an environment made for volus, for each minute in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer 
2d6 poison and 1d6 slashing damage. If you do not repair your suit or get to a volus-appropriate environment within 10 minutes, you die.

__Lucky__. You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one 
luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, 
but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then 
choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to 
influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

__Savvy Dealings__. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.

## Vorcha


The vorcha originate from Heshtok, a small, hostile, overcrowded planet which has been largely stripped of natural 
resources by successive generations of this fast-breeding, savage species. The lack of resources has resulted in a 
tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce 
resources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic 
necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which 
preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.

### Non-differentiated cells
The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found 
on the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to 
adapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive 
in high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly 
(~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.

### Clan Violence
Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their 
default form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with 
others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large, 
younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere. The vorcha are extremely aggressive, both against rivals of 
their own species and against any alien who stands in their way. Vorcha who have managed to escape their 
homeworld have a tendency to occupy uninhabited areas of space stations or larger spaceships.

### Vorcha Names
Like their lifespans, vorcha names are brutal and short.
___
- __Male names__: Besk, Drent, Dist, Flesk, Grank, Grote, Gryll, Jerst, Kreete, Shisk, Tirst, Tregg,  
- __Female names__: Ast, Brytt, Eesk, Fleeg, Ift, Ish, Keet, Kiv, Pash, Pritt, Shate, Tath  


### Vorcha Traits
Your vorcha shares a number of a traits (mostly agressive) with all other vorcha. They also have an adaptation, based on the 
environment in which they grew up.

__Galaxy Restriction__. Milky Way.

__Available Classes__. Engineer, Infiltrator, Sentinel, Soldier

__Ability Score Increase__. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

__Age__. Vorcha have extremely short lifespans and only live for 20 years. They reach adulthood shortly after their first year.

__Alignment__. Most vorcha are chaotic evil or almost always chaotic even if their morality is strengthened.

__Size__. Vorcha are taller on average than humans (though they naturally slouch) and relatively slender. Your size is Medium.

__Speed__. Your base walking speed is 14m.

__Starting Credits__. Instead of your class's starting equipment, you may start with 4d12 x 1000 + 10,000 credits to buy your own equipment.

__Bite__. Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing
damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

__Non-Differentiated Cells__. You are immune to disease. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have 
resistance against poison damage

__Limited Regeneration__. You regain all your Hit Dice on a long rest. Additionally, if you lose a body part, the missing part will regrow
and return to full functionality after a passing of time, based on the body part:
- __Fingers & toes__: 1 week
- __Hands & Feet__: 2 weeks
- __Arm (to elbow) & Leg (to knee)__: 4 weeks
- __Eye__: 6 weeks
- __Arm (to shoulder) & Leg (to hip)__: 8 weeks

#### Adaptation
Growing up in a harsh environment, your body evolved so you could survive. Choose one of the following environments:
___
- __Aquatic__: Amphibious. Swim speed 10m.
- __Desert__: Constitution +1. Ignore one level of exhaustion.
- __Frozen__: Resistance to cold damage.
- __High-gravity__: Strength +1.
- __Underground__: Darkvision 60m. Blindsight 10m.
- __Volcanic__: Resistance to fire damage.
- __Zero-gravity__: While lifted or in zero-g, your speed is 2m and you do not have disadvantage on your attack rolls.

# Chapter 3: Classes
Operatives are extraordinary beings, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are 
heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand 
against. 

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. 
Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and beings
in the galaxy. A soldier, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as 
just a pawn in a much larger game. An infiltrator, by contrast, might see himself as a willing agent in a governments’s 
unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various races. While the soldier has contacts in a mercenary group or army, the 
infiltrator might know a number of politicians, spies, and double agents. 

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a soldiers’s mastery of weapons and armor, and an adepts’s spells. 
At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing 
features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, 
and a detailed explanation of each one. 

There are only 6 classes in Mass Effect, each is either a specialist of hybird of two other classes. Adepts are biotic
masters and play similarly to wizards, focusing on spellcasting and control. Engineers are versatile tech masters with 
a wide range of tech powers and some healing capabilities, a mix of hunter, monk, and cleric. Soldiers are weapon masters
and are closely aligned with fighters from 5th edition. Sentinels are defensive tanks with the capability of casting both
biotic and tech spells, the paladins of the group. Infiltrators are very similar to rogues, utilizing tech from engineers 
and martial prowess from soldiers. Finally, vanguards are a kind of barbarian spellcaster, with combat capabilities of a 
soldier, but devastating biotics of an adept.

Operatives sometimes advance in more than one class. An engineer might switch direction in life and join a mercenary group
like the Blue Suns, becoming more proficient with weapons and armor, taking a few levels of a soldier. An asari infiltrator
may decide to focus on their biotic talents, taking some levels in adept or vanguard. Optional rules for combining classes in 
this way, called multiclassing, can be found in chapter 6.

  style='width:325px' />

## Adept

Adepts are biotic specialists, capable of disabling and killing enemies with raw biotic power. While they lack advanced combat training, they are the best at defeating enemies without firing a shot. They are outfitted with L5x implants that can spawn a micro-singularity, damaging enemies and pulling them into the air.


## Class Features

As a adept, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d6 per adept level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 6 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per adept level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

___
- __Armor__: Light armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose one from Melee or SMGs
- __Tools__: None
- __Saving Throws__: Charisma, Wisdom
- __Skills__: Choose three from Acrobatics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Sleight of hand,  and Survival

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- M-3 Predator or M-4 Shuriken
- Omni-Blade or Monomolecular Blade
- Stock Light Armor

```
```

### Spellcasting

Using your biotic implant or innate biotic talents, you can manipulate the mass of objects and space. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the adept spell list. You learn additional adept cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Adept table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.


#### Spell Slots
The Adept table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
adept spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

  style='width:300px' />


#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the adept spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more adept spells of your choice. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

</div>



#### Spellcasting Ability

Adepts have an L5x biotic implant which requires conscious control over their nervous system. As an Adept, you use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier




### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your combined Adept, Sentinel, and/or Vanguard levels,
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.


### Biotic Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than half your adept level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level adept, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page


### Subclass
At 2nd level, choose a subclass which represents how you focus on your biotic talents: force, necrotic, or control effects.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Empowered Biotics

At 17th level, whenever you roll a 1 on a damage roll for a biotic spell or cantrip you cast, you can reroll the die and must use the 
new roll.

### Biotic Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain biotics that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level
biotic spells that you have learned. You can cast those spells at 1st level without
expending a spell slot. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/3/3e/ME3_Volus_Adept.png/revision/latest?cb=20121009214956' 
  style='width:285px; position: absolute; top: 260px' />

<div style='margin-top:320px'></div>



### Signature Biotics

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose 
two 1st or 2nd-level biotic spells you know as your signature biotics. You can cast each of them once at 2nd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at 3rd-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Subclasses

Adepts have three subclasses which revolve around your biotic specialty. Force experts, called commandos, focus on dealing
the maximum amount of damage through biotic powers. Blackstars are control experts and use powers like pull and singularity
to hinder enemy forces. Disruptors focus on the necrotic powers of biotics and can maintain powerful spells at great length.


### Commando

Commandos don't need heavy weapons because they ARE the heavy weapon. Their features improve both the damage potential and throughput of their biotic spells, making them a deadly force.

#### Pure Biotics

At 2nd level, your skill in dealing damage with biotic force powers becomes unmatched. Add your proficiency bonus to all force damage dealt by your biotic spells.


#### Expert Biotic

By 6th level, casting biotic spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your efforts. When you cast a 
biotic spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a 
level lower than the spell you cast.

#### Biotic Split

At 10th level, when you cast a biotic spell that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

#### Overchannel

Beginning at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler biotics. When you cast a biotic spell of 1st or 2nd level that deals damage, 
you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you 
take 2d12 psychic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again 
before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and 
immunity.


### Blackstar

Blackstars prefer controlling the battlefield over raw power. They can shape their biotic powers to avoid hurting friends and gain unique benefits to biotic control spells like Lift, Singularity, and Stasis.

#### Sculpt Biotics

Starting at 2nd level, You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your biotic spells. When you cast a biotic spell that 
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half 
damage on a successful save.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>


\page

#### Bend Luck

You've mastered the art of using small mass effect fields to slightly alter the outcome of other creature's actions. It 
might be a small burst under the muzzle of a gun to throw off the attacker's aim. Or negative field around a friendly 
creature as leaps away from a grenade, moving it out of damage's way.


At 6th level, when another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you 
can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. 
You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

You can use Bend Luck a number of times equal to half of your Adept level (minimum 1) before you finish a long rest.


#### Focused Biotics

Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a biotic spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.


#### Biotic Control

At 14th level, you've increased your mastery with biotic spells that control the battlefield. Gain the following 
benefits to the spells below:

___
- __Lift.__ When casting Lift, you are considered to have both advancement options. |
- __Pull.__ When you cast pull, you may target 2 creatures. Make a ranged spell attack for each target.
- __Singularity.__ Large or smaller objects and creatures are affected by singularity.
- __Stasis.__ Targets have disadvantage on their saving throw.


### Disruptor

Disruptors have learned to tap into dark energy, improving biotic abilities that tear apart their adversaries from within. They also specialize in maintaining spells with intense focus.

#### Dark Biotics

At 2nd level, your skill in dealing damage with withering biotic powers is unmatched. Add your proficiency bonus to all necrotic damage 
dealt by your biotic spells.


#### Biotic Surge

Starting at 6th level, you can empower your biotics that unleash harm on groups of foes. When you force multiple 
creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spell's damage by rolling 
two more of its damage dice. This increase occurs only on the turn you cast the spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Potent Biotics

At 10th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

```
```

#### Biotic Concentration

Starting at 14th level, you can push your biotic implant to the limit. If you are already maintaining a concentration 
spell, you can cast another spell that requires concentration and maintain it. If you take damage you must make a separate Constitution 
saving throw to maintain each spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Engineer
The Engineer is a tech specialist, able to quickly and easily manipulate the environment with specific talents, and repair or modify technical equipment. Gameplay focus is on shaping the battlefield during combat, healing the party, and debuffing enemies (disabling weapons and lowering shields).

## Class Features

As a engineer, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d8 per engineer level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 8 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor, medium armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose one from Assault Rifles, Melee, or SMGs
- __Tools__: Choose one from Armorsmith's Workbench, Tailor's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Weaponsmith's Workbench
- __Saving Throws__: Constitution, Intelligence
- __Skills__: Choose three from Athletics, Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, Medicine, Science,  and Vehicle Handling

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-8 Avenger
- Omni-Taser, Omni-Blade,  or Omni-Torch
- Stock Light Armor or Stock Medium Armor

### Spellcasting

Your omni-tool is the source of your spellcasting capabilities. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Preparing and casting spells
The Engineer table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
engineer spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Engineer table.

For example, a 9th-level engineer can cast spells for 1, 2, or 3 tech points.

You prepare the list of engineer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the engineer spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of engineer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.


<img 
  src='https://n7.world/images/classes/engineer.png' 
  style='width:325px' />

For example, if you are a 4th-level engineer with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of engineer spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.


### Spellcasting Ability

Engineers use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an engineer, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Drone

At 1st level, you can summon a drone with your omni-tool. As an Action, spend 1 tech point to summon one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, disruption, recon, or rocket.

When summoned, the drone has additional hit points equal to twice your engineer level. Whenever the drone makes a saving
throw, damage or healing roll, add your proficiency bonus to the roll. Whenever the drone attacks, apply your proficiency bonus 
instead of the drone's to the roll.

You have complete control over the drone. Any hacking attempts on the drone are rolled against your intelligence, not the drone's. 
The drone has its own turn in the initiative order, which occurs immediately following your turn.

The drone lasts 1 minute or until its hit points become 0.

</div>


### Engineer's Efficiency

Starting at 3rd level, you're able to optimize a basic tech spell. Choose one of the following
tech powers: Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload. You always have this spell prepared. You may cast a 1 tech point version
of this spell without expending any tech points. If you cast the power at a high level, you must spend all tech points as normal.

You can prepare the advanced version of the selected spell at the cost of 1 prepared spell.

At 11th level, you can cast a 2 tech point version of your selected spell without expending 
any tech points.

With 8 hours of programming your omni-tool, you can exchange the selected spell with either Cryo Blast, Incinerate, or Overload.

```
```

### Ability Score Improvement


At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.

### Recharge

Beginning at 7th level, you've created a small reserve battery for your omni-tool, allowing you to regain some spent
tech points. Once per long rest, you can spend 1 minute cycling the power of your omni-tool gaining tech points equal to 
1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. Your total tech points cannot exceed the tech points column for your engineer level, as indicated on the engineer progression table.

The number of tech points you regenerate increases at higher levels. 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier at 11th level and 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier at 15th level.

### Invention

At 20th level, you create an invention. Work with your GM to decide on what the invention should be. Some ideas include an drone upgrade (weapon, armor, shield, etc), a new spell, an improved omni-tool battery, etc.


## Subclasses

Engineers have three subclasses which revolve around their engineering focus. Highly intelligent, battlefield strategists
use tact and preparedness to win at any cost. Some engineers prefer the tinkering lifestyle and can build a permanent
drone companion. Those that would like to focus on biological engineer should seek out the medic subclass, which can heal and support the party.

### Mastermind

Masterminds are highly-intellectual and skilled individuals, using strategy and perfectly timed attacks to win in battle.

#### Enfilade

Starting at 2nd level, if an ally uses a power that primes an enemy within 10m, you may use your reaction to detonate the primed enemy with a quick tech burst that cannot miss.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You regain any
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make
that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

  style='width:300px' />


#### Disrupting Attack

At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your tech spells.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against
a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.



#### Tactical Advantage

Starting at 14th level, when you prepare an advanced version of a spell you prepare both advancements. When you
cast an advanced spell you can choose to cast either advancement option.


#### Spell Steal

At 18th level, you gain the ability to clone spell effects onto your omni-tool.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell
save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect on you and you copy a temporary version of the spell onto
your omni-tool if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it does not have to be a tech spell). For the
next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your tech points. The creature can't cast that spell until the
8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Drone Jockey

A drone jockey forms a bond with their mechanical companion, giving it a body, name and increasing its potency on the battlefield.

```
```

#### Drone Companion


At 2nd level, you've learned to construct a drone companion. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 5000 credits worth of materials, 
you augment one of your drone's VI into a rudimentary AI, then create a synthetic body, transferring the AI into the body. 
Choose one of the following drones: assault, combat, defense, recon, rocket.

If your drone companion is ever slain, 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 2500 credits worth of materials, can create 
a new body and replicate the AI from a backup.

You can still summon a temporary drone using your tech points.


#### Drone's Bond

Your drone companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

* The drone companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.
* The drone companion loses its vulnerability to lightning damage.
* The drone companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you
  determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its
  own. It has advantage on saving throws against any ability that tries to influence its actions.
* Your drone companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your
  proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a drone
  companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
* Your drone companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.
* For each level you gain after the 2nd, your drone companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points 1d8 (or 5) + its constitution modifier.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion
  can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
  normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies
  otherwise.
* Your companion shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the
  tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The Engineer who created me is a beloved
  companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”

#### Coordinated Attack

Beginning at 6th level, you and your drone companion form a more potent fighting force. When you use the Attack 
action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make an attack.


#### Drone's Defense

At 10th level, your companion gains 10 shield points and 5 regen. Additionally, while your companion can see you,
it has advantage on all saving throws.


#### Assault Protocol

At 14th level, your companion can use its action to make an attack against each creature within 2m of it or each 
creature within 2m of you. It makes a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Drone's Defense

At 18th level, your companion gains another 10 shield points and 5 regen. Additionally, whenever an attacker that your
companion can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack’s damage against it.



### Medic

The name says it all. As a medic, you'll be one on the field that can dress a wound and get your comrades back into fighting shape.

```
```

#### Repair Drone

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine. If you are already proficient in Medicine, you may choose 
a different skill.

Add the Repair drone to the list of drones available for you to summon.

#### Medi-gel Enhancements

At 6th level, you can spend 6 hours in a lab, or similar environment, using drugs to enhance the capabilities of standard medi-gel. It 
takes 2 hours to craft a single enhancement, but you can apply that benefit to any number of medi-gel cartridges. To craft 
another enhancement takes an additional 6 hours. Instead of using time to limit this feature, your GM can choose to allow 
you to add X divided by 2 (rounded up) enhancements, where X is your Intelligence modifier; then, you must finish a long 
rest before you can create new enhancements. Only one enhancement can be added to a medi-gel cartridge.

___
- ___Stimulant.___ After using this medi-gel, you have advantage on the next saving throw or attack roll you make within 1 minute.
- ___Opioid.___ Within 1 minute of using this medi-gel, the next time you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn't kill you outright, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. 
- ___Steroid.___ After using this medi-gel, add +2 damage to all melee damage for 1 minute.

___
- ___Minagen X3.___ After using this medi-gel, gain +2 damage to all biotic spells and cantrips for 1 minute.
- ___Videlicet.___ After using this medi-gel, gain +2 bonus to all ranged tech attacks for 1 minute.
- ___Styptic.___ Increase the potency of the medi-gel by 1 level (maximum level is Superior)



#### Shield Boost

At 10th level, you can use your action to restore some of your party's shields. 
Choose up to 5 friendly creatures with shields you can see. Hack into their armor system and use a brute 
force algorithm to overload their kinetic barrier. Roll 4d8. Each creature immediately gains that many shield points, 
even if their total shield point capacity is less than the amount rolled.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.


#### Advanced Repair Drone

At 14th level, you summon an advanced version of the Repair Drone.

#### Supply Pylon

By 18th level, you can call in a 2m tall by 1m wide supply pylon to a location within 4m. At the start of your next turn, the pylon arrives. If any creature is 
standing in the targeted location, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage. 
On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

The pylon contains 5 resources from the following list, which you choose when you call the pylon:

* 1 heavy weapon ammo charges
* 10 thermal clips
* A battery capable to quickly recharging your Omni-tool, recovering 5 tech points
* A stim pack capable of staving off biotic fatigue, recovering 5 levels worth of spell slots 
* 4 enhanced medi-gel
* 2 Mk II Frag grenades
* 2 Mk II Lift Grenades
* 2 Mk IV Flashbang
* 2 Mk IV Smoke grenades

Once the pylon has landed, friendly creatures (including you) within melee range of the pylon can use their action to collect
one of the resources you chose.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest and restock the pylon with 5 omni-gel.

## Infiltrator

The Infiltrator is a tech-savvy warrior, able to win battles by quickly disabling and killing enemies. These soldiers focus on unlocking alternate routes, gaining access to good equipment, and obtaining an advantageous position over enemies in combat.

## Class Features

As a infiltrator, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d8 per infiltrator level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 8 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per infiltrator level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols and choose two from Assault Rifles, Melee, SMGs, and Sniper Rifles
- __Tools__: Hacking tools or theives' tools
- __Saving Throws__: Dexterity, Intelligence
- __Skills__: Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception, Electronics, History, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Vehicle Handling

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-92 Mantis
- Omni-Taser, Omni-Blade,  or Monomolecular Blade
- Stock Light Armor


### Spellcasting
Your omni-tool is the source of your spellcasting capabilities. You also use a variety of gadgets and devices in the form of combat powers. See chapter 12 for the
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 13 for the list of spells.

#### Preparing and casting spells
The Infiltrator table shows how many tech points you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
infiltrator spells, you must expend a number of tech points equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended tech points when you finish a long rest.

You are limited in the number of tech points you can spend to power a spell as indicated in the Tech Point Limit column
of the Infiltrator table.

For example, a 9th-level infiltrator can cast spells for 1 or 2 tech points.

You prepare the list of infiltrator spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the infiltrator spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of infiltrator spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your infiltrator level
(minimum of one spell).

You may prepare the advanced version of a spell for the cost of 2 regular versions. You may only prepare one advanced
version for each spell.

For example, if you are a 9th-level infiltrator with an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can be one of the following:

- seven regular spells
- one advanced spell and five regular spells,
- two advanced spells and three regular spells,
- three advanced spells and one regular spell

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of infiltrator spells
requires time spent to program them into your omni-tool: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Infiltrators use a highly modified Omni-tool that requires a keen intellect to maintain. As an Infiltrator, you use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a tech spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

</div>

### Tactical Cloak

As an action, you activate your tactical cloak, becoming <condition id="invisible"/>. Tactical cloak lasts 1 minute or
until you make an attack, cast a spell, use a grenade or mine, or fire a heavy weapon.

Once you have used tactical cloak the maximum number of times for your Infiltrator level,
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use tactical 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 6th, 4 at 11th,
and 5 at 18th.

### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either 
of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.



### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can 
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must 
be made with a melee or ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 2m of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, 
and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the 
Infiltrator table.


### Cunning Action

At 2nd level, you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to Dash, Disengage, Hide, or 
activate Tactical Cloak.


### Combat Power

At 2nd level, you know one combat power of your choice from the infiltrator spell list. You learn additional
combat powers of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Combat Powers column of the Infiltrator table.

Instead of learning a new combat power, you may instead learn the advanced version of a combat power you already know.

  style='width:325px' />

### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.

### Uncanny Dodge

At 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

```
```

### Evasion

At 7th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.


### Reliable Talent

At 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add 
your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible
creature within 4 meters of you.


### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.


### Elusive

At 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while 
you aren't incapacitated.


### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within 
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. 
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


## Subclasses
Infiltrators have three subclasses which reflect their preferred combat techniques. Shadow infiltrators prefer to be up close and personal, dealing devastating melee strikes. Snipers are the exact opposite and want to remain as far away from combat as possible. Saboteurs prefer more subtle techniques to turn the tide of battle in their favor.

### Shadow

Shadow Infiltrators are melee specialists that make heavy use of their tactical cloak and stealth to close the distance between themselves and their target.

#### Up Close and Personal

At 3rd level, when you apply your sneak attack damage from an attack made with a melee weapon, increase the damage die to d8.


#### Silent Cloak

At 9th level, your Tactical Cloak dampens noise. You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your 
speed on the same turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

#### Melee Prowess

Starting at 9th level, your skill with melee weapons becomes unmatched. You have +1 to melee weapon attack and damage rolls.


#### Shadow Strike

At 13th level, whenever you activate Tactical Cloak you may teleport to a target location within 10m. You must be able to see the location
and it cannot be occupied by a creature or object. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

When you arrive at the target location, you may use your reaction to make one melee attack on a creature or object within
range. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your
Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.

The teleportation can be used to free you from movement impairing effects such as grapple, restrained, lifted, etc.


#### Death Strike

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a
failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.


### Sniper

Snipers are ranged specialists that have an affinity for sniper rifles.

#### Steady Aim

At the 3rd level, your aim with a sniper rifle becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can overclock 
your targeting system to take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a sniper rifle you're wielding.
Your ranged attacks with the sniper rifle gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On a hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your infiltrator level.

This effect lasts 1 minute or until you use Steady Aim on a different target.

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

  style='width:285px; position: absolute;' />

```
```

#### Careful Eyes

Starting at 9th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action
as a bonus action.

You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).


#### Overwatch

At 13th level, you've become attuned to monitoring the movements of the battlefield, taking advantage of
when enemies break cover.

At the end of each of your turns, you may ready the following action. Choose up to 5 creatures you can see that are behind
half or three-quarter cover. Until the start of your next turn, if any of those creatures move into an area providing
no cover, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature. This attack can benefit from
your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target
more than once in a turn.


#### Killshot

At 17th level, your proficiency with sniper rifles is beyond measure allowing you to target the weakest points of your enemy.
When you apply your sneak attack damage to an attack made with a sniper rifle, add 3d6 to the damage roll.


### Saboteur

Saboteurs are tech savvy infiltrators that use cloak and dagger tactics to control the outcome of battles.

#### Saboteur's Touch

At 3rd level, you always have the sabotage spell prepared (it does not count against your list of prepared spells). Preparing the advanced
version of the spell counts as one spell, not two.

You can cast sabotage as a bonus action or as a reaction to a ranged weapon attack you can see.


#### Combat Heuristics

Starting at 3rd level, every time you bring an enemy to 0 hit points or score a critical hit, your HUD updates your tactical
feedback, restoring 1 tech point.


#### Tactical Ambush

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage
of any saving throw against the spell this turn.


#### Misdirection

Starting at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a 
creature within 2m of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target 
that creature instead of you.


#### Saboteur's Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take
two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn
at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your sentinel spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell
slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell lance, you must spend
one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

```
```

  style='width:225px; margin-top: -10px; margin-left: 50px' />

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sentinel spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sentinel table shows when you learn more sentinel spells of your choice of 1st level
and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new sentinel spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Sentinels use a unique L5t biotic implant that integrates with the operative's omni-tool maximizes their innate talents.
As a sentinel you choose your spellcasting modifier from Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. 

- Choosing Charisma means that your operative has immense willpower and uses it to overcome the mental strain of casting 
  biotic spells and interfacing with their omni-tool. They use their innate talent to maximize the potency of their spells.
- Choosing Intelligence means that your operative takes advantage of their omni-tool, using it to assist in the casting
  of biotic spells. Their keen intellect helps them choose strategic targets to maximize the potency of their spells.
- Choosing Wisdom means that your operative has unmatched concentration and can use the physical mnemonics of their
  biotic implant to cast tech spells with their omni-tool. Their patience and insight maximizes the potency of their spells.

You use your selected ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your selected
ability's modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your selected ability modifier

### Tech Armor

You've bolstered your armor with a powerful, defense-oriented AI. As a bonus action or as a reaction to taking damage,
activate your Tech Armor.

When activated, tech armor creates a new kinetic barrier with additional hit points equal to the sum of your sentinel level
and spellcasting modifier, multiplied by 2. When you have tech armor hit points and take damage, the tech armor hit points 
are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your shields and/or normal hit points. Tech armor lasts 1 minute 
or until it has 0 hit points remaining.

While tech armor is active, you can use your action to overload it. Each creature within 4m must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the remaining hit points of your tech armor, 
or half as much on a successful one.

You can use Tech Armor twice between long rests.

```
```

### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level (whichever is highest),
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

When holding no more than one light, non-two-handed weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to hit with ranged spell attacks

```
```
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.

#### Sniper
If no hostile creature is within 10m of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks made with a sniper rifle.


### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Quick Cast

At 6th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you may make a weapon attack as a
bonus action.


### L5t Implant (3rd-level)

At the 11th level, choose one spell and an advancement for that spell of 3rd-level or less. You can cast this
spell once as a 3rd-level spell without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

### L5t Implant (4th-level)

At the 13th level and again at 15th level, choose one spell and an advancement for that spell of 4th-level or less. You can cast this

spell once as a 5th-level spell without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.


### Reset

At 20th level, you can draw power from the depths of exhaustion. If you spend one minute calming your mind or recalibrating
your armor you can regain all of your expended spell slots or all spent uses of your tech armor. Once you use this feature,
you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Subclasses
Sentinels have three subclasses which reflect their connection with their Tech Armor. Bastion sentinels forego upgrading their tech armor for leadership on the battlefield. Juggernauts focus entirely on defense and can take an impressive amount of damage. Guardians prefer to boost their allies with unique subroutines and keep themselves safe with an omni-shield.

### Bastion

Bastion sentinels are battlefield leaders. They can easily turn the tides by calling out orders, inspiring troops, and synchronizing troop movements.

#### Tactical Focus

At 3rd level, your tactical acumen and predictive VI algorithms allow you to provide direction to your
allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action, you can select an area within 30m on the ground that measures 6m on each side. This area is your tactical focus.
It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you become <condition id="incapacitated"/>.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three
tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 14th level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can
swap one of your tactics for a different one.

Additionally, at 7th level the size of your tactical focus becomes 8m on each side. At 14th level the size becomes 10m on each side.

<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/b/b9/ME3_Asari_Valkyrie.png/revision/latest?cb=20121009221210' 
  style='width:300px; position: absolute; bottom: 50px; left: 50px' />


```
```

#### Tactics
Choose from the following tactics.

__Advance__.
Update your allies' HUDs and outline optimal routes to your tactical focus. If an ally spends all of its movement
moving towards your tactical focus, it doubles its movement, ignores difficult terrain, and does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.

__Analysis__.
Focus all of your attention on the movements and capabilities of a single enemy. When you choose this tactic, you
additionally choose a single hostile creature within your tactical focus. Beginning when you set your tactical focus
and at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, the DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or
inferior in regard to one of the following characteristics of your choice: One ability score (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom), Armor Class, or Current hit points

__Clear the area__.
Pick out weak spots on your targets that force them out of your tactical focus. If an ally hit s a creature in your
tactical focus with a weapon attack, the ally can move that creature 2m.

__Heads up__.
If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it has advantage on that saving throw.

__Pin down__.
When a hostile creature attempts to move out of your tactical focus, two target creatures of your choice can use
a reaction to make an attack of opportunity on the target. If both attacks are successful, the creature's movement becomes
0, it falls prone and remains in your tactical focus.

__Recon__.
Your VI focuses on the movement of dust and augments sound from your area of focus, reconstructing a perfect image on your
and your allies' HUD. Any creature within your tactical focus loses any benefits from being invisible, lightly obscured,
or heavily obscured.


#### Master Tactician

At 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking
a creature, the target of that attack can be within 20m of you, rather than 2m of you, if the target can see or hear you.


#### Ever Ready

By 7th level, you've learned to never let your guard down. You have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your
first turn, but only if you activate your tactical focus, selecting an area that encompasses your location, before doing
anything else on that turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

#### Call the Shots

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to focus all of your attention on your tactical focus, calling out
threats, troop movements, and enemy weaknesses.

Until the start of your next turn:

- Whenever a friendly creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and adds the result to its attack roll or saving throw.
- Whenever a hostile creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, it rolls 1d6 and subtracts the result to its attack roll or saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended
uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Tactical Maneuvers

At 14th level, you can provide leadership that allows your allies to move in perfect harmony.

In place of moving, you can instead allow up to three allies within 30m move up to half their speed. The chosen allies
must be capable of taking actions in order to move in this manner.


#### Synchronized Assault

Starting at 18th level, you gain the ability to unleash a devastating combination of your allies' abilities. As a
bonus action, select up to five allies within 60m. They can use their reactions to immediately take actions.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.


### Juggernaut

Juggernauts are living tanks and nearly impossible to take down. Their tech armor upgrades make sure they can take a hit, or one hundred, without so much as a scratch.

#### Assault Armor

Starting at 3rd level, your Tech Armor is rigged for keeping the action on you. When
you activate tech armor, you project a distracting holographic image (your choice) and each hostile creature within 20m
that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting modifier). On a failure,
a creature is compelled to attack you while your Tech Armor is active. A creature that is compelled to attack you always 
targets you when it makes a weapon or spell attack.

Each time a creature that is compelled to attack you takes damage from a source other than you, it makes a new Wisdom saving 
throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is no longer compelled to attack you and is immune to
Assault Armor for the next 24 hours.

Synthetic creatures have advantage on the Wisdom saving throw.


#### Hardened Tech Armor

At 7th level, you're able to shrug off hits that would normally devastate others. While your tech armor
is active, you have +1 AC and any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

```
```

#### Advanced Tech Armor

Starting at 10th level, your tech armor benefits from the energy used to cast biotic and tech powers. Whenever you
cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, your tech armor gains 10 hit points. When you cast a cantrip, you tech armor gains 3 hit points.


#### Unyielding Assault

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen.
While tech armor is active, you are immune to becoming paralyzed, stunned, or frozen.


#### Adaptive Tech Armor

At 18th level, when your tech armor takes damage, it gains resistance to that damage type. If more than one
type of damage happens simultaneously, tech armor gains resistance to both.

  style='width:325px; margin-top: -60px' />

### Guardian

Guardians support and buff party members by utilizing different AI packages from their Tech Armor ability and protecting them with their Omni-Shield. They're also one of the most skilled classes, gaining the Expertise feature twice.

#### Expertise

At 3rd level, and again at 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either 
of the chosen proficiencies.


#### Omni-Shield

Starting at 3rd level, you've mastered the omni-shield. As a bonus action, create a large kinetic shield out 
of your omni-tool that lasts one minute. You can end Omni-shield at any point as a free action.

While Omni-Shield is deployed you cannot use another omni-* melee weapon. Instead, gain the following:

* +1 AC.
* If a creature within 2m of you is attacked, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack.
* As an attack action, you may make a melee attack roll. On a hit, deal 1d12 bludgeoning damage. You may shove a
hit creature backward 2m.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.


#### Tech Aura

In addition to the standard defensive VI, you've augmented your Tech Armor to run different VI packages. 
At 7th level, when you activate
tech armor, you can choose to run a different VI package instead. When you activate an alternate package, you
do not gain hit points, instead, you and any friendly creature within 10m of you gain
the effect of the package for 1 hour. You may only have one tech armor active at once.

At 14th level, if you have no remaining uses of Tech Armor, you can expend a spell slot to activate it.

At 18th level, increase the distance of your Tech Aura packages to 20m.

__Defensive,__ This is the standard Tech Armor package. It does not affect allies.

__Anti-biotic.__ Resistance to force and necrotic damage.

__Anti-tech.__ Resistance to fire and cold damage.

__Grounded.__ Resistance to lightning damage.

__Reactive.__ Add your spellcasting modifier to Strength or Dexterity saving throws.

__Speed.__ Increase speed by 6m. Can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.

__Regen.__ Regenerate shield points equal to your spellcasting modifier on the start of each of your turns.

__Inspiring Music.__ Advantage on saving throws against becoming frightened or charmed.

__Brute force.__ Creatures within your aura deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage with melee attacks.

__Negation Field.__ Creatures within your aura can't be primed.

#### Sculpt Spells

Starting at 10th, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your spells. When you cast a spell that
affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half 
damage on a successful save.

#### Omni-Shield

Starting at 14th level, you can transform your omni-shield into a fire shield or cryo shield.

__Fire Shield__. Gain all the benefits of Omni-Shield. In addition, a target hit by a Fire Shield attack takes 3d10 fire damage. 
This damage detonates primed targets, but you are immune to any detonating effects.

__Cryo Shield__. Gain all the benefits of Omni-Shield. In addition, a target hit by a Cryo Shield attack takes 1d8 cold 
damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or become <condition id="frozen"/> until the end its next turn.

### Adrenaline Rush

You can inject yourself with a shot of adrenaline, pushing yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
At 2nd level, you can take one additional action this turn on top of your regular action and a possible 
bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Starting at 17th level, you can use Adrenaline Rush twice per short rest but not more than once in a single turn.

### Tactical Reload

weapon your holding becomes 0, you can use your Reaction to take the Reload action for that weapon.


### Indomitable

At 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature 
again until you finish a Long Rest.

list. As an action, you can spend 1 omni-gel to create and use a grenade of that type. The Mark of the grenade you create

You can spend 8 hours of programming to exchange a selected grenade with a different one.

options for it. For each combat power you have already learned, pick an advanced option for it. If you have already learned

#### Weapon of Choice

By 3rd level, you have undergone extensive training with a single weapon type. Choose a weapon type which becomes your Weapon of Choice. 
When you are holding your Weapon of Choice you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. 
You may spend 1 month of intensive training to exchange your Weapon of Choice with another weapon type.

__Superiority Dice__: You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 
You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. 

You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* When you make a weapon attack against a creature with your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of 
the attack are applied.
* When you damage a creature with a weapon attack from your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority die to add 
it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution 
saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.
* When you are hit by a melee attack, if you are currently holding your Weapon of Choice, you can expend one superiority 
die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.



#### Strafe

At 7th level, when you take the Dash or Disengage action, you can make 1 weapon attack with your Weapon of Choice as a bonus action at 
any point during your movement.


#### Weapon of Choice

You gain another superiority die (5 total) at 10th level and the die type becomes a d10.


#### Devastating Critical

Starting at the 15th level, when you score a critical hit with your Weapon of Choice, you gain a bonus to that 
weapon's damage roll equal to your soldier level.

#### Weapon of Choice

You gain another superiority die (6 total) at 18th level and the die type becomes a d12.



### Gladiator

Gladiators are pure-combatants, focused on winning at all costs and being nearly impossible to take down.

#### Fighting Spirit

Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on
your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so,
you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this
class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Vengeance

Starting at 7th level, you can overcome grievous injuries. When you would make a death
saving throw, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of adrenaline. You immediately stand up (if you so
choose), and you regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Then, you may draw any weapon you are carrying,
choose a target a creature within that weapon's normal range, and make 2 attacks with the weapon.

If the target creature is the same one that reduced you to 0 or fewer hit points, you have advantage on both attack rolls.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Tireless Spirit

Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.


#### Additional Fighting Style

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

#### Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack 
against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the 
same target as a bonus action.


#### Strength before Death

Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you
to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can
immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking
damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the
extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Vanguard
Vanguards are feared for their high-risk high-reward combat style, closing quickly on enemies and destroying them at close range with weapons and biotic abilities. They are outfitted with L5n implants, enabling them to perform a biotic charge that strikes the opponent with incredible force while closing distance.

## Class Features

As a vanguard, you gain the following class features

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d12 per vanguard level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 12 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per vanguard level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor, medium armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols, Melee and choose one from Shotguns or SMGs
- __Tools__: None
- __Saving Throws__: Strength, Wisdom
- __Skills__: Choose three from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand,  and Survival

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-23 Katana
- Omni-Blade, Omni-Hammer, Monomolecular Blade,  or Riot Shield
- Stock Light Armor or Stock Medium Armor

### Spellcasting

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the vanguard spell list. You learn additional vanguard cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Vanguard table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.

### Spell Slots
The Vanguard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
vanguard spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

```
```

  style='width:325px' />


### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
Starting at 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the vanguard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Vanguard table shows when you learn more vanguard spells of your choice. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 9th level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

### Spellcasting Ability

Vanguards are outfitted with the L5n biotic implant which draws upon their inner strength of will and focus on their
physical mnemonics. As a vanguard, you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier



### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

</div>

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level (whichever is highest),
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.


### Fighting Style

At 1st level, choose a fighting style from the list below.

#### Assault
When you make a Burst Fire attack, the DC of the saving throw is 17.

#### Brawler
Add your proficiency bonus to your melee attack damage rolls.


```
```

#### Carnage
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Close-Quarters Shooter
When making a ranged attack while you are within 2m of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half-cover against targets within 10m of you.

#### Defense
+1 AC

#### Gunslinger
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light ranged weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light ranged weapon that you’re holding in the other hand.

#### The Free Hand
When holding no more than one light, non-two-handed weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to hit with ranged spell attacks


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page


#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.

#### Sniper
If no hostile creature is within 10m of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks made with a sniper rifle.


### Danger Sense

Starting at 2nd, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this 
benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


### Zero-Sum

At 2nd level, when you make a melee attack, instead of rolling a dice, you can flip a coin. On heads, it's a critical hit. On tails, 
it's a critical miss. You can use this ability once per short rest. 



### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Tactical Barrier

At 7th level, whenever you take damage while barrier is active, you choose how many barrier ticks to spend. You may choose to spend 0
barrier ticks.


### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. At 13th level, you can roll two additional damage die. And at 17th level you can roll three additional damage die.


### Heavy Barrier

At 11th level, when you expend a barrier tick to reduce damage, each barrier tick reduces the damage by 3d8.


### Retaliation

At 15th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack 
against that creature.

```
```

### Primal Biotics

At 20th level, your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.


## Subclasses
Vanguards have three subclasses which represent their combat style.

### Battle Master

Battle masters use their barrier to execute unique maneuvers on the battlefield, controlling and harrying enemy forces.

#### Biotic Maneuvers

At 3rd level, you learn three maneuvers that are fueled by your barrier ticks. You can use only one maneuver per attack. At 10th level, learn 2 additional biotic maneuvers and another 2 at 14th level.

Some of your maneuvers 
require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver effects. The saving throw DC is 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier.

___Disarming Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the barrier tick die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

___Distracting Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

___Feinting Attack.___ You can expend one barrier tick and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 2m of you as your target. You have advantage on your next melee attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll.

___Goading Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

___Lift Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to lift a Medium or smaller size creature or object. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is lifted.

___Menacing Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to frighten the target. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

___Pushing Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to drive the target back. You add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 8m away from you.

___Riposte.___ When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to make a melee attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll.

___Sweeping Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 2m of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes force damage equal to the number you roll on your barrier tick.

___Trip Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to knock the target down. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.


#### Biotic Focus

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to focus your biotic energies into your muscles granting additional 
speed and strength. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* Your speed is doubled. 
* +4 to all melee weapon damage rolls.
* You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### Improved Barrier

At the 10th level, increase the die type of your barrier ticks to d10. At 18th level, it increases to d12.


#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 14th level, you can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Opportunist

At 18th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature 
within 2m of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack 
against that creature.


### Shock Trooper

Shock troopers like to fight up close and personal, using charge to dash around the battlefield and ripping enemies apart with shotgun blasts.

#### Biotic Bull Rush

At 3rd level, you learn the charge cantrip. If you have already learned it, you may learn a new cantrip instead.

The distance of charge is now 20m. When you use your action to cast charge, you may use a bonus action to shove or make one
weapon attack against the target. You gain +5 to the attack’s damage roll or shove the target 6m. To shove a target this
way, it must be no more than one size larger than you.

#### Stunning Strike

Starting at 6th level, you can focus your barrier into the impact of your charge spell. When you hit a creature
with your charge cantrip, you can spend 1 barrier tick to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be <condition id="stunned"/> until the end of your next turn.


#### Shotgun Savvy

At 10th level, Brutal critical and Zero-sum can be applied to shotgun weapon attacks.



#### Onslaught

At 10th level, you've mastered your charge spell, maximizing its damage. The damage of charge becomes d10 +
your spellcasting modifier.

#### A Touch of Force

At 14th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons with your barrier. As a bonus action, you can expend
up to 3 barrier ticks to grant one weapon you're carrying a bonus to damage rolls equal to the number 
of barrier ticks spent. The additional damage is force damage and can detonate primed targets. This effect lasts
1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Blitz

Starting at 18th level, whenever a creature within 20m that you can see makes a weapon attack or casts a spell, you can use your reaction to
cast charge, targeting that creature. Resolve any effects caused by charge before the creature takes its action. The creature
may choose to make a different action this turn.


### Nemesis

Nemesis vanguards prefer distance and using biotic powers. While they lack the raw power of an adept, they're more crafty and harder to take down.

#### Biotic Recovery

At 3rd level, you have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than a third of your vanguard level (minimum 1), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 10th-level vanguard, you can recover up to 4 levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
two 2nd-level spell slots, one 2nd-level and two 1st-level spell slots, or four first-level spell slots.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

#### Metabiotics

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use the power stored in your barrier to twist your spells to suit your needs. 
You gain two of the following Metabiotic options of your choice. You learn another one at 10th and 14th level.

Metabiotics can only be applied to spells of 1st level or higher.

___Careful Spell.___ When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 barrier tick and choose a number of those creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

___Distant Spell.___ When you cast a spell that has a range of 2m or greater, you can spend 1 barrier tick to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 barrier tick to make the range of the spell 10m.

___Empowered Spell.___ When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 barrier tick to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metabiotic option during the casting of the spell.

___Heightened Spell.___ When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 barrier ticks to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

___Quickened Spell.___ When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 barrier ticks to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

___Twinned Spell.___ When you cast a spell that doesn't have a range of self and is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level, you can spend a number of barrier ticks equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell.



#### Biotic Attacks

At 6th level, you choose one biotic cantrip you know and one biotic spell of 1st level you know. 
You may cast either spell as an attack.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.


#### Biotic Fury

Starting at 10th level, the effects of brutal critical and zero-sum can be applied to your biotic spells
that require a spell attack roll.


#### Teleporting Dodge

At 14th level, as a reaction to an effect that causes you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use 2 Barrier ticks to automatically
pass the saving throw.


#### Bombardment

Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your biotics intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the
highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage.
You can use the feature only once per turn.

# Chapter 4: Personality and Background

Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

## Character Details
Your character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. 

### Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even
if you’re just picking one from a list.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your
character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. For example, asari only have a single "gender", which
is generally seen by other races as female (they also utilize female pronouns). But an asari considers herself as androgynous
or hermaphroditic. You could also play a male character who presents himself as a female, a woman who feels trapped in
a male body, or a tough looking female krogan who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s
sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description. Think about
what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin.
A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in centimeters) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in kilograms) beyond the base weight. 

```
```

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment
is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes
toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently
faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

__Lawful good (LG)__ creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Asari justicars, quarians,
and some turians are lawful good.

__Neutral good (NG)__ beings do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many salarians and most
protheans are neutral good.

__Chaotic good (CG)__ creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.
Some angara, asari, and a number of humans are chaotic good.

__Lawful neutral (LN)__ individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Some geth, volus, and
most drell are lawful neutral.

__Neutral (N)__ is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what
seems best at the time. Volus, some batarians, and many humans are neutral.

__Chaotic neutral (CN)__ creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.
Maiden asari, some vorcha, and humans are chaotic neutral.

__Lawful evil (LE)__ creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or
order. Most Krogan, volus, and batarians are lawful evil.

__Neutral evil (NE)__ is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.
Heretic geth, Reapers, and vorcha are neutral evil.

__Chaotic evil (CE)__ creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
Some Krogan, batarians, and some Vorcha are chaotic evil.

### Languages

Languages are not a part of Mass Effect 5e. Our interpretation is that there is enough technology to translate languages
on the fly, making it seem that everyone is speaking the same common tongue. Even new discovered races can have their
languages mapped into a universal translator in a number of hours utilizing underlying linguistic morphisms and lexical
cues fed into a supercomputer. However, how you and your GM choose to handle ancient or alien languages is up to your party.
Your asari archaeologist might be an expert in ancient alien glyphs or you might lay a Krogan who is known for reciting
poetry in an old dialect. This type of flavor is encouraged, but this system does not codify any specific languages.

```
```

### Personal Characteristics

Fleshing out your character’s personality — the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person
a unique identity — will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are
presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s
favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this section includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your
imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.

#### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart
from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character.
They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.
“I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in on the Exonet” tells
you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character
dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define
one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example,
or be cocky about your high score.

#### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental
moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to
make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background
includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality.
The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

#### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world.
They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against
your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations
and goals.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND</div>

\page

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?
What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or
personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your missions.

#### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness —
in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests.
More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you?
What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the galaxy master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or
her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.

### Gaining Inspiration
Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your
personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a
compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your
inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply
doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story
in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.


## Variant: Paragon & Renegade
With the Variant: Paragon & Renegade (P/R) rule, players accrue points in either Paragon or Renegade which can add
bonuses to skill checks.

### Earning Points
The primary way to each Paragon or Renegade points is by taking actions or role-playing that personality. This mechanic
works similarly rewarding Inspiration (described above), but the reward can be 1-5 points based on the impact of the
choice and whether the choice aligns with Paragon or Renegade. GMs can also reward points to the entire party based on a
decision they make while playing the game. Did the party destroy the potentially life-threatening biological weapon
(Renegade) or send it to authorities for research in vaccinations (Paragon).

### Point maximum
You can gain points in Paragon and Renegade, but your total combined points can never be more than 100.
For Galaxy Masters, you want to award about 5 points of paragon or renegade per player level. I.e., a level 20 character
should have about 100 points if they added their P/R scores together.

### Using points
Your Paragon and Renegade points can add a bonus to skill checks. You gain a +1 bonus to your skill check for every
10 Paragon or Renegade points you have. For example, if you had 14 Paragon points and 22 Renegade points, you would
add +1 to any paragon rolls and +2 to any renegade rolls.

A Paragon or Renegade roll is any skill check in which your GM allows your P/R bonus to augment the outcome of the roll.
It's the player's responsibility to ask the Galaxy Master about adding the P/R bonus, but the Galaxy Master can
proactively ask for a check with the P/R bonus added.

When to or when not to apply P/R bonus to a roll is entirely up to the GM. However, the rule of thumb is that the
action taken is more Paragon-like or more Renegade-like than what an average sentient being would do.

### Paragon vs Renegade
What constitutes Paragon and what constitutes Renegade is a bit fuzzy. Paragon is neither Lawful nor Good, just as Renegade
is neither Evil nor Chaotic. However, both traits _tend_ to fall closer to those respective spectra.

Try to think of Paragon and Renegade flavors of a character's or party's choices. Paragon choices are open-ended,
allowing for future possibilities, utilitarian (benefits the most people), logical, and rely on the pen over the sword.
Renegade choices are decisive and final, emotional, gain immediate results, and often use a show of force.

#### Paragon examples
___
- __Acrobatics.__ jump in front of a bullet to protect someone
- __Athletics.__ Hold fast a door why your party escapes a threat
- __Intimidation.__ Threaten someone with justice
- __Medicine.__ Stabilize an enemy because they might provide information
- __Vehicle Handling.__: Lead your chasers right to the authorities

#### Renegade examples
___
- __Athletics.__ Hold fast a door so the threat burns inside
- __Deception.__ Convince the bounty hunters their target fled into that cave (which happens to be booby-trapped)
- __Electronics.__ Broadcast the controversial research to the galaxy, let the politicians and scientists figure it out
- __Intimidation.__ Threaten someone with pain
- __Vehicle Handling.__ Lead your chasers right into a reinforced-steel wall

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an operative, and
your place in the galaxy. Your soldier might have been a mercenary or a former Specter. Your adept could have been a
government experiment or a celebrated artisan. Your infiltrator might be a political assassin or gathered intel for the
Shadow Broker.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question
to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?
Where did you get the credits to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.


#### Proficiencies 
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5. If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. 

```
```

#### Equipment 
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional starting credits for your race from chapter 2 to spend credits on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. 

#### Suggested Characteristics 
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. 

#### Customizing a Background 
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend credits on gear as described in chapter 2. (If you spend credits, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

While within your colony, you can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them.
They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
A colonist is generally not far traveled and has lived most their life on a single planet. However, colonies can vary in size,
governmental structure, and socioeconomic status. Colonists see their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming,
and their home communities remain very important to them.

- __Tool Proficiencies__. Two starship systems of your choice.
- __Equipment__. A pressurized space suit, a set of common clothes, a gaming set, and 1000 credits.

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a starship for yourself and your adventuring
companions. You might voyage on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained
by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your
every need. Your Galaxy Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage,
you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Use the Sailor background's suggested characteristics in the D&D Player's Handbook, pg. 139.


### Criminal
___
- __Skill Proficiencies__. See _Specialty_ below.
- __Tool Proficiencies__. One type of gaming set, thieves' tools
- __Equipment__. Thieves' tools, a gaming set, a set of common clothes, and 1,500 credits.

#### Feature: Criminal Contact 
You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance
of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any
respect for law or authority.

or gain access to normally off-limits locations by leveraging your position as a doctor if your services are needed.

### Experiment
___
- __Skill Proficiencies__. Science and Survival.
- __Tool Proficiencies__. Tinker's Tools and your choice of Medical Kit, Disguise Kit, or Chemist's Supplies.
- __Equipment__. A set of common clothes, a trinket from your program of origin, Tinker's Tools, and 300 credits.

#### Feature: What Doesn't Kill You 
You were the subject of experimentation in your youth, with the goal of stripping
away the old you and turning you into a weapon. The program could have been funded by your race's government, a
shadow organization, or a single mad scientist who kidnapped you. It could have had the goal of turning you into the
ultimate soldier, perhaps an unrivaled biotic, or even a genius tech engineer.

Regardless of the program's nature or success, you survived your difficult trials and came out tougher for it. You've
been pushed to the edge of death before, so it doesn't scare you. Once per long rest, you can choose to make a death
saving throw with advantage due to your strong drive to survive.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Experiments are all maladjusted to society, but not all experiments are unable to adapt. Most experiments prefer to be loners
and come off as aloof or emotionless. Over time, with a close-knit group, some experiments tend to open up and show a softer side.

- __Equipment__. A disguise kit, a set thieves' tools or hacking tools, a badge or emblem of your faction, a set of bio-encryption keys, and 1,000 credits

#### Feature: Safe Haven 
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and other agents who can
provide assistance. You know a set of secret signs, encrypted communication channels, and passwords you can use to identify
such agents, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Faction 
As a faction agent, you're part of a larger faction, which could be criminal, military, religious, political, etc.
You can work with your GM to create a faction or you can use an existing one from the Mass Effect Universe. Some faction
examples are the Shadow Broker Network, Blue Suns, Special Tasks Group, Cerberus, Eclipse, and the Blood Pack. Agents
are more than hired mercenaries and are supportive of their faction's efforts.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Faction Agents are shaped by their experience in the line of duty. The beliefs, laws, and practices of their faction can
affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy that counteracts the tenets of their faction.
For example, a Shadow Broker Agent that secretly wants transparency of information. Or they might have an ideal or bond
that is taken to an extreme, such as a Cerberus agent that hates all non-human races and kills them whenever possible.

4 | I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complicated ones.
5 | I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others.
6 | I can’t keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else’s.

from security breaches typically make paranoid or uneasy individuals who romanticize seemingly mundane events, tasks,
and social situations.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: armories and weaponsmiths, tailors and jewelers,  armor and weapon mod shots, not to mention bars, brothels, and other seedy locations. In the largest cities on the more
civilized planets (and especially in the Citadel), almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to multimedia and civilian transports. For an operative, the availability of armor, weapons, themal clips, grenades, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death during a covert mission or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and technologically advanced merchandise that operatives commonly find useful in the face of galactic threats.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively,
you can start with a number of credits based on your race and spend them on items from the lists in this section and appendicies. See chapter 2 for more information on using racial starting credits.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance or goods that the
character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as
part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from
generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

##### Starting Wealth by Race

| Races | Credits |
| :--- | ---: |
| Asari, krogan | (10d4 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Human, quarian, turian | (8d6 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Elcor, volus | (10d6 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Angara, batarian, drell, hanar | (6d8 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Geth, prothean | (2d10 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Salarian, vorcha | (4d12 x 1,000) + 10,000 |


## Wealth
Wealth appears in many forms in a Mass Effect 5e galaxy. Credits, precious metals, trade goods, art objects, animals, and
property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the lower classes trade in goods, bartering for
what they need and paying taxes in all aspects of life.

Members of the upper-class trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mining facility, an asteroid point, or
land on an eezo rich planet or in equipment and tech, measuring tech by profitability rather than the credits. Only
shopkeepers, operatives, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.

<br>

> #### Currency
> __Credits__ are the only type of currency in Mass Effect. The guideline conversion rate from D&D 5th Edition to Mass
Effect 5e is:
> ##### 1 gp = ~100 credits

<br>

### Selling Items

Opportunities abound to find tech, gadgets, equipment, weapons, armor, and more throughout the galaxy. Normally, you can
sell your bounty when you return to a civilized planet or spaceport, provided that you can find buyers, entrepreneurs, and
fencers interested in your loot.

__Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.__
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons
and armor used by mercenaries are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Instead, you may opt to break these items down
into _omni-gel_.

__Gems, Jewelry, Art Objects, and Artifacts__.
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency
for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or
larger community first.

__Trade Goods and Other__.
On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods - bars of
raw metal, chemicals, livestock, omni-gel, and so on - retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

#### Discounts
Longtime Mass Effect players will certainly want to reference Shepard's ability to secure discounts from local shops. One option
is to have players make Intimidation or Persuasion checks (with or without Paragon/Renegade scores). However, for
added variety and randomness, you can use the following set of rules.

First, assign a DC to your shopkeeper. The DC could be equal for Intimidation and Persuasion, or it could be different for each.

Next, have you player make an Intimidation or Persuasion check. If using Paragon/Renegade rule, they can add their Renegade modifier to
Intimidation checks or Paragon modifier for Persuasion checks. The result of this check adds a modifier to the final d100 roll (see next step).

| If the player... | Their modifier is... |
|:--- | :---: |
| rolls a critical failure | -50 |
| fails the check | -20 |
| succeeds on the check | +20 |
| rolls a critical success | +50 |



<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>



\page



<div class='wide descriptive'>
 
##### Discount Resolution

Finally, the GM or player rolls a d100 adding the modifier from the previous step. Consult the following table for the resolution.

<div style='width: 60px;'>d100</div> | Result
:---: | :---
<= 10 | The shopkeeper is furious that you would attempt to cheat them out of their wares. They will not do business with you or your party.
11-30 | The shopkeeper sees through your ruse. If you're going to play it that way, you'll have to pay 10% more.
31-50 | The shopkeeper is unmoved. They aren't going to give you a discount, but they're not shutting their doors either.
51-70 | The shopkeeper has seen these ploys before, but you gave him a good chuckle, for that, you get a 10% discount.
71-90 | Better to work with you than against you, the shopkeeper offers you a 20% discount.
>= 91 | Either completely enthralled with your proposal, or scared out of their wits, the shopkeeper offers you a one-item discount of 50% off, and a lifetime discount of 20% off.

</div>

## Armor

To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,
futuristic weapons but armor also supplies __shield points__, also called shields (outlined below). Luckily, almost all
garments in the mass effect world provide some form of protection. Diaphanous night-gowns can even provide a modicum of
protection. Thus, in Mass Effect 5e, almost all operatives are wearing armor and are afforded shield points, unless the player
or GM explicitly states your character is not wearing armor.

__Armor Proficiency__. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type
know how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).
If you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,
saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack
proficiency with, you cannot cast spells.

__Armor Class (AC)__. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.

__Shield Points__. All armor chest pieces
provide some amount of shield points. See _Shields_ in chapter 9 for more information.


### Mix & Match
Unlike D&D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:
__Head__, __Chest__, __Arms__, and __Legs__.

Your base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in
the Armor / AC bonuses table. Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,
explained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.

__Heavier Armor__. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the 
Armor Bonuses and Limitations table shows “Str 12” or “Str 16” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor 
reduces the wearer’s speed by 4m unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

For simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor *within* placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm
and a light piece of armor on your left.

<br>

>#### Variant: Encumbrance
>If you are using the _Variant: Encumbrance_ rules,
>use the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.
>
>|Placement/Type|Light|Medium|Heavy
>|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
>|Chest|3kg|6kg|10kg|
>|Arms|1kg|2kg|3kg|
>|Legs|1kg|2kg|3kg|
>__Head__. All headware weights 2kg

| 1 piece of Medium armor | Max +2 | - | - |
| Light or no armor | + Dex modifier | - | - |

___Body Armor_ is considered three pieces (arms, chest, and legs)__

</div>


### Armor Sets
Most armor you buy in the galaxy has been mass-produced, these are called __armor sets__. A set is not required to be
multiple pieces of armor. For example, the Capacitor Helmet is a single piece of head armor. The unique aspect of armor
sets is that they have benefits and attributes that are pre-installed due to their mass-production. Thus, you cannot
customize armor sets with armor mods and you cannot salvage a beneficial aspect from an armor set.

Armor sets have an armor type (light, medium, or heavy) which you use for calculating your character's AC.

A full list of armor sets can be found in Appendix A.

#### Body Armor
Body Armor is a special type of armor piece that consists of 3 pieces of armor: Chest, Arms, and Legs. Body 
armor is completely integrated (all or none), therefore, you cannot swap out pieces from other sets. I.e., if you're 
wearing the Duelist body armor, you cannot replace the legs from it with the Lockdown Greaves. This rule is, of course, flexible,
as GMs might allow this type of tinkering in exchange for time, credits, and/or skill checks. 

#### Set Bonuses
Set bonuses are additional benefits you receive from wearing multiple pieces from the same set, signifying the armors
component pieces working together for a unified integration. Armor with the same base name is part of a set, e.g. __Colossus__ _[item]_. 

```
```

You only receive the benefit once per set and the benefit ends immediately if you fall below the threshold. For example, 
if a set provides:

##### Medium Armor
- __Set Bonus (2 of 4)__: +1 AC 
- __Set Bonus (4 of 4)__: +1 AC

If you are wearing the head and chest pieces, you gain +0 AC from the helmet and +2 AC from the chest piece (as calculated using the Armor / AC table). In addition you gain +1 AC from wearing 2 pieces of the set.

Note, you _do not_ gain +1 AC for the head _and_ +1 AC for the chest. As soon as you remove either the helmet or the chest piece, you loose the +1 AC bonus.


### Environmental Protection
All armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough
air and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require
that your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the __bubble rule__ and claim that all armor suits
can cast an energy "bubble" around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>



\page

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

__Don__. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

__Doff__. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

##### Donning and Doffing Armor
Category | Don | Doff
:--- | :---: | :---:
Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute
Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute
Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes

### Customizing Armor

For characters that want to create unique armor, they can craft or purchase upgradable armor pieces. To craft armor, your character needs to be proficient with Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools. Then they must spend the necessary
amount of time and omni-gel as listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table. Note that it takes much less time and resources to craft
these basic armor pieces than it does to craft armor sets due to the simplicity of the armor your character is creating.

Characters may instead purchase customizable armor for the cost listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table.

Once you have crafted or purchased your armor piece, it is time to add benefits to the armor using __armor mods__. Each
piece of customizable armor has a set number of mod slots and you can add additional slots (up to the maximum) for more
time and omni-gel (if crafting) or credits (if purchasing). You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest,
head, legs, or arms.

A full list of Armor Mods can be found in Appendix B.

#### Rewarding Custom Armor
Your GM might reward you with a custom piece of armor that you've looted or found during a mission. When you are rewarded
with a custom piece of armor, make sure you write down how many total mod slots the piece has and what armor mods are
currently installed.

<br>

> ##### Example Armor Creation
> Imogen wants to create a fancy chest piece for her character Tiiva. She wants to add another mod slot for a
maximum of 3 armor mods. Tiiva spends 4 long rests (8 hours in each rest) and 20 omni-gel to create a medium piece of
chest armor. 
>
>Alternatively, she could have spent 30,000 credits to purchase the armor piece.
>
>Next Imogen spends 30,000 credits
on the ablative coating mod. She also looted an asymmetric defense layer mod from a previous
mission. She spends 2 more long rests applying those mods, giving her chest armor resistance to piercing damage
and +2 AC. She leaves her third slot empty for the time being, hoping to loot another mod and fit it in later.

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to
use. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the
difference between life and death while on a mission.

Appendix C has the full list of available weapons, their price and weight, the damage
they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.
A __melee__ weapon is used to attack a target within 2 meters of you, whereas a __ranged__ weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

<br>

> ##### Melee and Heat
> In Mass Effect 5e, melee weapons are considered to be one weapon type, and ranged weapons are divided by their gun type.
>
> __Melee__. while there are fewer options for melee weapons and the damage is somewhat less, all melee weapons and melee attacks by-pass shield points. This is explained further in the _Shields_ section of chapter 9.
>
> __Heat__. Almost all ranged weapons have heat which is the number of times a weapon can be fired before it must be reloaded. If the weapon has a heat of 1 and you fire it, you must reload the weapon with a fresh thermal clip before firing it again. Reloading takes an action.

<br>

### Weapon Proficiency
You must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 7 distinct weapon
types and all weapons fall into one of the following types.

___
- __Assault Rifles__. The most common weapons of the military. These are generally medium-range weapons that deal average damage with a high heat capacity.
- __Heavy Pistols__. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.
- __Sub-machine Guns (SMGs)__. Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.
- __Shotguns__. Close-range, high-damage blasts.
- __Sniper Rifles__. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.
- __Melee__. Used in close-quarters combat. _Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields_.
- __Heavy Weapons__. Specialty weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. _Heavy Weapons do not have a proficiency requirement_.

```
```

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in Appendix C.

___
- __Arc.__ Deals lightning damage. On a hit, deals half of the damage dealt to 1 additional creature within 2m of the hit target. If there is more than one creature within 2m of the initial target, choose the second target randomly.
- __Burst Fire.__ Can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 4m-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This action uses 3 heat.
- __Double Tap.__ When you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you can use your bonus action to make a second ranged attack. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. The second attack may be on the same or a different target.
- __Finesse__. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- __Heavy__. Requires a minimum Strength score of 15. Creatures with a Strength score lower than 15 have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons as its size and bulk is to cumbersome to use effectively.
- __Hip Fire.__ When making a ranged attack on a target creature within 2m, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- __Light.__ A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
- __Range.__ A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in meters, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
- __Reach.__ This weapon adds 2 meters to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
- __Recoil.__ A weapon with the Recoil property generates a lot of kickback when fired. You use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- __Silent.__ Makes no noise when used to make an attack roll.
- __Special.__ A weapon with the special property generally has unusual rules governing its use explained in the weapon notes. Additionally, special weapons cannot be improved by weapon mods.
- __Two-handed.__	This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. Takes up 2 weapon slots.
- __Thrown.__ If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
- __Versatile__. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

#### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes
any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.


Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to
a club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were
that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).
If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,
it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 6 meters and a long range of 18 meters. Light improvised thrown weapons have ranges of 10m and 30m, and heavy improvised ranged weapons have ranges of 4m and 12m.


#### Heavy Weapons 
Heavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.

__Targeting.__ Most heavy weapons require the Targeting condition to use. Targeting means painting the battlefield or keeping a lock on one or more creatures for a single round of combat. More information about targeting can be found in appendix G.


### Carrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons
You have 4 weapon slots unless a feature or armor mod allows you to have more. _Two-handed_ weapons take up 2 slots.

If using the Variant: Encumbrance rule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.

You can holster one weapon you're wielding or draw one weapon you're carrying as a free action. This is true for all weapon types.
However, to holster one weapon *then* draw a second weapon would require an action.
But the GM might allow a Sleight of Hand check to see if you can holster and draw at the cost of your bonus action.

## Mods

Armor and weapon mods allow you to upgrade your equipment, providing powerful bonuses. All mods have their
own costs. Operatives who are proficient with Tinker's tools can craft mods but most can be purchased from your local equipment shop. Once you've acquired your mod, you can install it yourself (if you're proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or Weaponsmith's tools) or you can have an equipment shop install it for you.

```
```

### Removing Mods
In general, mods cannot be removed. Those proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or Weaponsmith's tools may attempt to
salvage mods at the risk of destroying the weapon or piece of armor and all other installed mods. Equipment shops around the galaxy typically won't offer this service for fear of a lawsuit.

### Armor Mods
Installing armor mods requires you to craft or purchase a piece of customizable armor. See
the Custom Armor section above. Each piece of customizable armor
has a set number of mod slots. You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest, head, legs, or arms.

A full list of armor mods can be found in appendix B.

### Weapon Mods
Weapons are only allowed one mod per slot. For example, the M-8 Avenger cannot have the Ultralight Materials and the
Precision Scope, because both of those mods utilize the Body slot. 

Some mods are limited by weapon type. For example, the Stunner mod is only available for placement on Heavy Pistols and SMGs. 

Finally, you cannot add weapon mods to any weapon with the _special_ property.

___
- __Ranged weapon mod slots.__ _Magazine_, _Body_, _Ammo_, and _Barrel_.
- __Melee weapon mod slots.__ _Grip_, and _Strike_.

A full list of weapon mods can be found in appendix D.

## Mission Critical Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

### Thermal Clips
Thermal Clips weren't in use until about 2184. Depending on when you set your campaign, this presents a discrepancy in
the timeline. Your GM may choose to overlook this fact and continue with the thermal clip rules, or use the _Variant: Venting_ rule.

___
- __Use.__ When you reload your weapon, you expend a thermal clip.
- __Capacity: 10.__ All armor comes standard with 10 thermal clip slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: ~100 credits__. Thermal clips are easily looted from almost every enemy wielding a weapon. However, you can also resupply all of your thermal clips at a gun shop or military depot for about 100 credits. However, because thermal clips are so easily attainable, GMs might find it more manageable to simply not keep track of thermal clips and assume players will always have a steady supply available to them.


<br>

> ##### History of Thermal Clips
>It was discovered that, in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most
rounds downrange the fastest. As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth,
and shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the
availability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of
firing. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the
environment.


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/f/f3/ME3_Upgrade_Sniper_Rifle_Spare_Thermal_Clip.png/revision/latest?cb=20120315143250' 
  style='width:225px; position: absolute; left: 100px' />
  
<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

#### Variant: Venting
Instead of thermal clips, each weapon's heat indicates the number of times it can be fired before it overheats. Replace any reference to __Reloading__ with __Venting__. Venting works exactly the same as reloading, taking some amount of time to vent the weapons heat (instead of reloading a thermal clip).

If a weapon is not fired for a full round of combat, it naturally regains 1 heat. Additionally, any weapon that is at
0 heat can be fired, but it automatically jams and cannot be used until after a long rest.




### Heavy Weapon Charges
Heavy weapons require _charges_ to be used. A charge is a generic term that can refer to a missile, energy source, or
raw material.
___
- __Resupplying: ~5,000 credits.__ If you've got your hands on a heavy weapon, you're either a military specialist or damn lucky you survived the battle. It's not easy resupplying your charges. You'll need to have some serious military or black market connections. If military, you might get special permission to keep the weapon and granted a steady stream of charges (once per long rest). That's between you and your Galaxy Master. Otherwise, you'll have to pay a pretty penny on the black-market to recharge your Heavy Weapon (5,000-7,000 credits for a complete resupply of charges). In most cases, it's easier to scavenge or steal ammo. Or simply leave the damn thing where you found it.


### Grenades & Mines
Grenades and mines provide various types of explosive mechanics to use in the heat of combat.
___
- __Use.__ Using a grenade is the same as using an item, requiring one Action.
- __Capacity: 2.__ All armor comes standard with 2 grenade slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: ~500 credits per grenade.__ Grenades are a military resource, so, depending on your campaign setting they might be an uncommon or rare item. If your character is part of a military outfit, you can resupply every time you return to base (or to your ship). Otherwise, finding grenades may be a bit more difficult, requiring you to barter, steal, or loot them. A recommended cost is 500-1000 credits per grenade or mine.

Appendix E has a full list of available grenades.

#### Higher Marks
Grenades and Mines can range in power from Mark I to Mark X. Each grenade description describes the effect of higher marks.
It is recommended that each higher mark costs at least 1.5 times more credits than the previous mark: 

##### Recommended Cost per Grenade
| Mark | Credits |
| :---: | :---: |
| I | 500 |
| II | 750 |
| III | 1,250 |
| IV | 1,800 |
| V | 2,500 |
| VI | 3,800 |
| VII | 5,700 |
| VIII | 8,500 |
| IX | 13,000 |
| X | 20,000 |

### Medi-gel
Medi-gel (medical gel) is an all-purpose medicinal salve combining an anaesthetic and clotting agent used by paramedics,
EMTs, and military personnel, produced by the Sirta Foundation. It heals various wounds and ailments, instantly sealing
injuries against infection and allowing for rapid healing by having the gel grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency
of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids - most notably blood - as well as contaminants and gases.

___
- __Use.__ As an action, use a medi-gel pack on yourself or a willing creature within 2m. The target regains hit points equal to the medi-gel's potency as listed in the Medi-gel Types table.
- __Capacity: 4.__ All armor comes standard with a capacity for 4 medi-gel. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: varies.__ As long as you're in a relatively civilized environment, you can easily resupply your medi-gel at a medical facility. However, you would need insider or black-market connections to get Superior or Ultimate medi-gel. Since Ultimate medi-gel is so rare, the cost is entirely dependent on the people you know, favors your owed, or ability to break into a medical facility.

##### Medi-gel Types
| Type | Rarity | Cost | HP Regained |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Standard | Common | ~200 credits | 2d4 + 2 |
| Enhanced | Uncommon | ~500 credits | 4d4 + 4 |
| Superior | Rare | ~1,500 credits | 8d4 + 8 |
| Ultimate | Very Rare | ? | 10d4 + 20 |


### Omni-gel
Omni-gel is a technological material that can be obtained by breaking down unwanted items, such as weapons, armor, and
upgrades. Doing so will usually give an amount of omni-gel based on the item that was dismantled.

Omni-gel is composed of common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys kept in a semi-molten state.
It is designed for use with omni-tools to do electronics and decryption work, make general repairs, and even craft new upgrades.
Each canister of omni-gel is stored in a canister and is worth 1,000 credits.

##### Omni-gel Yield
| Equipment | Yield |
| :--- | :--- |
| Armor & Weapon Mods, Tools & Kits | 1 |
| Heavy Pistols, SMGs, and Head, Leg, and Arm armor | 3 |
| Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, and Chest Armor | 6 |
| Heavy Weapon | 10 |

  style='width:280px' />

### Omni-tool Programs

Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator.
The fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics,
ceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the
reuse of salvaged equipment.

Most omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator
designs.  However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general
population's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs
that have been scrubbed from the exonet.

For a full list of Omni-tool programs, see appendix F.

#### Installation

Some omni-tool programs require an operative to integrate the module into the tool's microframe before the benefits can
be used. This process is called Installation, and certain programs have a prerequisite for it.

Installation requires an operative to spend a short rest focused on only installing and debugging the program. If the short
rest is interrupted, the installation attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the operative gains the
benefits of the program.

A program can be installed to only one omni-tool at a time. Almost all programs come with a powerful DRM and security
system that prevents the program being installed on multiple omni-tools or replicated. Interestingly,
before the humans were granted an embassy on the Citadel in 2165, the concept of digital rights management was foreign to
the other races of the galaxy. But since 2165, omni-tool programs have been locked down. Attempting to hack the DRM
generally has a terrible result.

An omni-tool can only have three programs activated at once. Any attempt to install to a fourth program fails; the operative
must first uninstall the program from their tool (this also takes a short rest). Once uninstalled, the program can be
traded and installed on a separated tool. Additionally, omni-tools can't have more than one copy of a program installed.





<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\page


#### Single-Use Programs

Manufacturers and militaries quickly realized it was much easier, cheaper, faster, and (usually) safer to send bits of
data rather than physical products, and let fabricators generate the devices on site using generic materials, like omni-gel.
After the advent of omni-tools, a number of industries used this method to ship their products. However, to avoid
unauthorized replication, the programs would scrub themselves once the job was complete.

Omni-tool programs that don't require installation are single-use and cost a number of omni-gel to create the final product.
Once used, the program is completely wiped. As with installed programs, attempts to recreate these pieces of code can be
costly, even deadly.

#### Unstable Programs

Unstable Programs are entirely experimental, therefore the number of times you can run the program varies widely. In some
cases, unstable programs are single-use programs that are hacked for multiple uses. A GM can create an Unstable Program
from a Single-Use program by assigning a die roll (d4, d6, etc) to the number of times the program can be used.


## Tools & Kits

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or hack
a security system. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a
tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to
a single ability since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

### Tool Proficiency

Mass Effect 5e utilizes the Tool Proficiency rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78). In summary, it's
unclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have
specific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.

Thus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with
skills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.
The second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.

__Advantage or Added Benefit__. When the character combines their tool proficiency with a skill, they gain _additional insight_ 
which means the operative either gains advantage on the skill check or they can gain an added benefit, decided by the GM. 

For example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet) or they might gain
an added benefit, such as finding some additional information or key codes.

__Unique Skill__. Operatives proficient in a tool have a unique activity they can perform during a short or long rest.
For example, a character proficient with Armorsmith's Workbench can craft armor or attempt to remove mods. 

__Sample Activities__. Each tool also has sample activity DCs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list. GMs can adjust
DCs or create new activities as they see fit. These activities require a skill check, but the skill used is up to the GM.
For example, an operative proficient with hacking tools can disable a security system. This would likely require an
Intelligence (Electronics) check, but if the security system required splicing wires, it might require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check instead.



### Armorsmith's Workbench

## Expenses

When not infiltrating an enemy's base, exploring prothean ruins or unknown planets, or waging war against the encroaching reaper threat, operatives face more mundane realities. Even in the sci-fi world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in the galaxy. They cover your
accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your
equipment so you can be ready when mission next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Lifestyle Expenses table and pay the price to
sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over
a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the
rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

##### Lifestyle Expenses
|Lifestyle|Credits/Day|
|:--- | :---: |
|Wretched|-|
|Squalid|25 credits|
|Poor|75 credits|
|Modest|150 credits|
|Comfortable|250 credits|
|Wealthy | 500 credits|
|Aristocratic|1,000 credits minimum|

__Wretched__. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into
transit tunnels, huddling in alleyways, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
people covet your armor, weapons, and gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice
of most people.

__Squalid__. You live in the slums, a condemned building, a repurposed shipping container, or a roach-infested boarding
house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you
have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be
disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

__Poor__. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,
threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your
accommodations might be a room in a rundown apartment, the basement dwelling of a business, or the bunker of a faction.
You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

__Modest__. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in
an older part of the city, renting a room in a crowded apartment. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living
conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students,
service workers.

__Comfortable__. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your
equipment. You live in a nice apartment in a middle-class neighborhood or in a small townhouse. You associate with
shopkeepers, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

__Wealthy__. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social
status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly
successful small business owner, a politician, or a doctor. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a
good part of town or a comfortable suite at the top level of an apartment building. You likely have a small staff of workers
to maintain your home or run day to day errands.

__Aristocratic__. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in
the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a mansion in the nicest part of town or a luxurious suite. You dine
at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have workers attending to your every need.
You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful and spend evenings in the company of politicians,
community leaders, and other elite persons. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The
wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

>##### Self Sufficiency
>
>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures on an advanced planet
in a city or town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford - paying for food and lodging, paying
skilled workers to mend your armor or service your weapons, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend
their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
>
>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your
time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in
Survival the skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

# Chapter 6: Customization Options
The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the 
personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have 
options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players—with the GM’s permission—want to go a step further. This 
chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you 
combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain 
levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign. 

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to
realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining
a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For
example, if you have three levels in engineer and two in sentinel, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another
class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start
progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some
focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your
new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into
the infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training
that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites

|<span style='font-size: 11px;'>Class</span>|<span style='font-size: 11px;'>Ability Score Minimum</span>|
|:---|:---|
|Adept|Wisdom 13|
|Engineer|Intelligence 13|
|Infiltrator|Dexterity 13 and Intelligence 13|
|Sentinel|Intelligence 13 or Wisdom 13|
|Soldier|Strength 13 or Dexterity 13|
|Vanguard|Strength 13 and Wisdom 13|


```
```

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character
Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP
to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a
class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same
die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a
sentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them
separately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example,
if you are a soldier 3/infiltrator 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting
proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's
starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Barrier, Extra Attack, and Spellcasting.

#### Barrier
Your barrier capacity depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your
individual levels in those classes. You determine your barrier capacity by adding together all your levels in the
vanguard class and half your levels (rounded down) in the adept and sentinel classes. Use this total to determine your
barrier capacity by consulting the Multiclass Barrier table.

##### Multiclass Barrier:

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make
more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier's version of Extra Attack does).

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your 
individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. 
If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

__Spells known and prepared.__ You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually as if you were 
a single-classed member of that class. If you are an adept 4/engineer 3, for example, you know six 1st-level adept spells 
and five adept cantrips based on your levels in the adept class. As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer spells. 
If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six engineer spells.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
class when you cast the spell.

You can only use spell slots to cast biotic spells and you can only use tech points to cast tech spells. The exception
is Sentinels that can use their spell slots to cast biotic or tech spells.

__Spell Slots.__ You determine your available spell slots and cantrips by adding together all your levels in the adept class 
and half your levels (rounded down) in the sentinel and vanguard classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots and 
cantrips by consulting the Multiclass Biotics table.

##### Multiclass Biotics:

__Tech Points & Tech Point Limit.__ You determine your tech points and tech point limit by adding together all
your levels in the engineer class and half your levels (rounded down) in the infiltrator class. Use this
total to determine your tech points and memory by consulting the Multiclassing Tech table.

## Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, 
experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. This section provides a list of available and unavailable feats
from D&D 5th Edition's _Player's Handbook_ as well as some new feats for the Mass Effect universe.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo 
taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description 
says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use 
that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

```
```

### Card Shark
_Prerequisite: Charisma 12 or higher_
___
You've sunk considerable time into playing cards for credits in seedy dives and upscale casinos alike, and, through 
countless wins and losses, you've honed your gamesmanship into a thing of beauty. You gain the following benefits and features:

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with two types of gaming sets of your choice.
- You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to bluff opponents in games of chance and Charisma (Persuasion) checks to convince others to join you for a game.

### Come Get Me
Conventional wisdom in combat is to avoid being targeted. You prefer an alternate school of thought, keeping enemies 
focused on you and off of your less stalwart allies.

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- As an action, you can make a feint to draw enemy attention. This feint may be a war cry, a loud insult, or a different distraction. All enemies within 16 meters must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a successful saving throw, a target is unaffected and is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. On a failed saving throw, an enemy has disadvantage on attacking any creature except you for the next minute, or until they make an attack against you. You may use this ability once per short or long rest.


### Cranial Bruiser
_Prerequisite: Krogan_
___
Krogan are notorious for using any weapon within reach - even the armored plates that cover their foreheads. 
- You can attack with a headbutt, which is a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.
- When you use the Dash action during your turn, you can make a melee attack with your headbutt as a bonus action.

<img

  style='width:160px; position: absolute; left: 130px' />

```
```
### Enhanced Optics
Your optic nerves have been enhanced by science to perceive more.
- Gain darkvision.
- You now gain proficiency in Perception, Investigation, and Insight. If you are already proficient in any of these, gain expertise instead.

- If you are wearing all light armor (or no armor) and have only one weapon equipped, your speed increases by 4m and you avoid triggering any pressure-activated traps or mines.


### Grace Under Fire
While others may lose their cool in the face of sustaining a wound, you've learned how to use that burst of pain and 
stress to move faster. You gain the following benefits and features:
- Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Immediately after you receive damage from an enemy attack, you may use your reaction to move up to half your movement without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Grenadier
_Prerequisite: Dexterity or Strength 12 or higher_
___
When you use a grenade, you may choose to make a ranged weapon attack (10/30m) on a creature instead of choosing a target location.
Add your dexterity or strength modifier (your choice) and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the grenade
deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + dexterity or strength modifier (same as used to make the ranged attack). The target
also has disadvantage on the saving throw caused by the grenade. The grenade lands at the target's location.
On a miss, the grenade lands 2m beyond the target. On a critical miss, roll 2d4. The first die represents the number of
spaces away from the target in which the grenade lands. The second die represents the direction (1 = North, 2= East,
3 = South, 4 = West). E.g., 2 & 2, the grenade would land 2 spaces east of the target. Once the grenade's location is
determined, it resolves normally.

- +2 grenade capacity
- __Improvised Grenades__. You can make grenades from scrap metal and scavenged materials. Acquire 1 frag grenade every long rest. The Mark of the frag grenade is equal to your level divided by three, minimum 1.




### Hair-Trigger
_Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher_
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you use your bonus action or free action to make a ranged attack with a Double Tap weapon, you add your ability modifier to the damage roll.


### Nerves of Steel
___
Traveling the galaxy has exposed you to violence and cruelty, been deceived and seen almost every trick in the book. Not 
much can make you flinch anymore. You gain the following benefits and features:
- You have advantage on all saving throws made to resist becoming charmed, frightened, and stunned.
- While charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can use a bonus action on your turn to repeat the saving throw to end the 
  effect. This saving throw is not made with advantage.

```
```

### Squad Leader
You know just what to say in a tight situation.

As a bonus action, you can inspire all allies within earshot to instantly roll a hit die and regain that many hit
points. This does not expend a hit die from their pool. Allies immediately recover from the following
conditions: _charmed_, _frightened_, _incapacitated_, _paralyzed_, _poisoned_, _prone_, _restrained_, and _stunned_. You
may use this ability once per long rest.

  style='width:175px; margin: 50px' />

### Warlord's Blood Rage
_Prerequisite: Krogan_
___
Your blood rage is exceptionally deadly, rivaling those of the krogan warlords in Tuchanka. You gain the 
following benefits while using your Blood Rage trait:
- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either total.
- As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.
- When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one additional damage dice and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.


### Wealth of Knowledge
_Prerequisite: Intelligence 13 or higher_
- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on the first Intelligence-based skill check you make after a short rest.

# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

<div style='margin-left: 60px; margin-top: -65px'>
- __Strength__, measuring physical power
- __Dexterity__, measuring agility
- __Constitution__, measuring endurance
- __Intelligence__, measuring reasoning and memory
- __Wisdom__, measuring perception and insight
- __Charisma__, measuring force of personality
</div>

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these
qualities - a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. 

The three main rolls of the game - the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll - rely on the six ability scores. The Introduction describes the basic
rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the
total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not
just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related
to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but operatives and many monsters are a cut above average in most
abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. operatives can have scores as high as 20, and
monsters can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a
score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores,
from 1 to 30.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers
<div style='column-count:2'>

</div>

```
```

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw,
or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you
have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and
a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more
than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and
you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice
versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the volus' Lucky trait, lets you reroll the
d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a volus has advantage or disadvantage on
an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the volus could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells.
Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide
that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.


## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their
stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different
rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when
you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.
For example, the infiltrator’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or
divide it only once.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>


\page

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that
wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check, your
proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency
in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make
Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows
you to do so, these same rules apply.


## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The
GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance
of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of
the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes
table shows the most common DCs.


##### Typical Difficulty Classes

<span style='font-size:11px;'>Task Difficulty</span>|<span style='font-size:11px;'>DC</span>
:---|:---:
Very Easy|5
Easy|10
Medium|15
Hard|20
Very Hard|25
Nearly impossible|30

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and
penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success -
the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes
no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.


### Contests
Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are
trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a grenade that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal - for example,
when a brute tries to force open a door that an operative is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a __contest__.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and
penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with
the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other
one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might
win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a grenade the floor, neither character grabs it.
In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an operative trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that
the door remains shut.


### Skills
Mass Effect 5e is a sci-fi setting, thus some of the fantasy skills (like religion and arcana) have been replaced with new
skills.

___
- __Removed Skills__: _Animal Handling_, _Arcana_, _Nature_, _Religion_
___
- __New Skills__: _Electronics_, _Engineering_, _Science_, _Vehicle Handling_

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in.
A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a
focus on that aspect. A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's
skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or
to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth,
respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related
to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. No skills are related to Constitution. See an
ability's description in the <nuxt-link to="/phb/appendix/skills">Appendix: Skills</nuxt-link> for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.


<div style='column-count:2'>

__Strength__<br>Athletics

</div>


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>


\page

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill - for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”
At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,
proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If
the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character
lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

<br>

>##### Variant: Paragon & Renegade
>In Mass Effect 5e, you may also choose to use the Variant: Paragon & Renegade rules (see chapter 4).
>This new rule allows you to apply another bonus to your ability checks, pending the context of your action is _Paragon-ish_
>or _Renegade-ish_.

<br>
### Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the
average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for laser tripwires over and over again, or can be used when
the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a
hidden sniper.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

<div style='font-size:11px; text-align: center;font-family:sans-serif'>
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
</div>

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check
total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
(Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the "Dexterity" section below rely on passive checks, as do
the exploration rules.

### Working together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort - or the one with the
highest ability modifier - can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.
In combat, this requires the __Help__ action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to hack a
security system requires proficiency with hacking tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another
character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some
tasks, such as reloading a thermal clip, are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.
In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds,
the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters
succeed or fail as a group. For example, when operatives are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group
Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the
environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of
danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.



## Using Each Ability
Every task that an operative might attempt in the game is covered by on of the size abilities.

### Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or
to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

__*Athletics*__. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, Jumping, or swimming.

__*Other Strength Checks*__. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
  - Break free of bonds
  - Push through a tunnel that is too small
  - Hang on to a hover car while being dragged behind it
  - Tip over a dormant mech
  - Restraining an elcor

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as
an omni-hammer, a monomolecular blade, or a krogan warhammer. Additionally, ranged weapon marked with the _Recoil_ property
allow you to overcome the kickback of the weapon with brute force. You may apply your Strength modifier to your attack roll
and damage roll when attacking with _Recoil_ weapons.

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.
These weights have been adjusted from 5th Edition to work with kilograms (kg) instead of pounds (lbs).

__*Carry Capacity*__. You can carry capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 5. If you are wearing armor, your carry
capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 10 (due to the built-in servos and pneumatics). This score is not affected
by weapons or armor (see below).

__*Push, Drag, Lift*__. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in kgs up to twice your carrying capacity or 10 (20 w/ armor)
times your Strength score. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 2 meters.

__*Size & Strength*__. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category
above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

__*Weapons*__. You have 4 weapon slots and can equip a single weapon in any slot. _Two-handed_ weapons require 2 weapon slots. Weapons equipped in a slot do not affect your carry capacity. Any additional weapons you pick up count against your carry capacity.

__*Armor*__. The Armor Bonuses and Limitations table has a minimum Strength score for the combination of armor types. You
must meet or exceed that score. See the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5.


#### Variant: Encumbrance

The lifting and carrying rules attempt to keep the simplicity of 5th edition, with the added restrictions of weapon capacity. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the minimum Strength column of the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5 and ignore the weapon slot limitation.

- __Your carry weight is equal to two times your Strength score__
- Each weapon and armor piece has a weight. If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of your
  carry weight, you are __encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 4m.
- If your total weight from all weapons and armor is in excess of four times your Strength score, you are instead
  __heavily encumbered__, which means your speed drops by 10m and you have disadvantage on ability
  checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.




### Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing.
The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth and Vehicle Handling skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

__*Acrobatics*__. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking spaceship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

__*Sleight of Hand*__. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

__*Stealth*__. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

__*Vehicle Handling*__. If you're driving a vehicle you're familiar with, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity (Vehicle) check to make a difficult maneuver or avoid heavy weapon fire, crash land, or weave between traffic. However, if you are unfamiliar with a vehicle, the GM would require a Wisdom (Vehicle Handling) check to see if you can pilot the vehicle at all.

__*Other Dexterity Checks*__. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Disable a tripwire mine
  - Securely tie up a prisoner
  - Wriggle free of bonds
  - Play a stringed instrument
  - Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as an
assault rifle or a sub-machine gun (SMG). You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the _finesse_ property, such as an omni-blade or a monomolecular blade.

#### Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class. See the _Armor Bonuses and Limitations_ table in chapter 5.

#### Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of
creatures' turns in combat.

#### Hiding
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until 
you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that 
actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as 
shouting a warning or bumping into a crate. An _invisible_ creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still 
be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature,
it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature
that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

__Passive Perception__. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine
whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the
creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency
bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
of 14.

__What Can You See?__ One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how
well you can see in an area, which might be __lightly__ or __heavily obscured__.


### Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability
represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.
A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire pint of Batarian Shard Wine in one gulp
- Resist the effect of poison

#### Hit Points
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each
Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from
1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier
increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add
3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier.
Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1,
your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.



### Intelligence
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The
Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, and Science skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

__*Electronics*__. Your Intelligence (Electronics) check covers attempts to hack or interface with computer systems, such as when you're trying to open locked doors and containers, turn off cameras, override controls, etc.

__*Engineering*__. Your Intelligence (Engineering) check covers your knowledge of machines and mechanical devices. It most cases it determines your ability to repair devices. But you might also use it to spot weaknesses in mechanical defense systems, spot potential vehicle failures before they happen, or find expensive parts in space salvage.

__*History*__. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient or alien races and their cultures or customs, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

__*Investigation*__. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in Search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

__*Science*__. Your Intelligence (Science) check measures your ability to make useful connections and correlations based on the wealth of knowledge that can be found on the exonet. In a sense, it measures your 'scientific mindset'. A GM might ask for a check when encountering unknown flora or fauna, assessing the geology of an alien world, or analyzing natural or unnatural phenomena.

__*Other Intelligence Checks*__. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Estimate the value of a piece of tech
  - Create a false ID badge
  - Forge an electronic document
  - Recall lore about an ancient civilization
  - Win a game of skill


#### Spellcasting Ability
Engineers, infiltrators, and some sentinels use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.


#### Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the
environment, or care for an injured person. The Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude
in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

__*Insight*__. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body Language, Speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

__*Medicine*__. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion, diagnose an illness, or understand the biology of an organism.

__*Perception*__. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss.

__*Survival*__. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to survive in uncivilized alien words, especially harsh environments like tundra, deserts, or jungles. The check might help you navigate a blizzard, find food in a wasteland, or avoid getting eaten by a Thresher Maw.

__*Other Wisdom Checks*__. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
  - Discern whether a seemingly life-like android is organic or synthetic

#### Spellcasting Ability
Adepts, vanguards, and some sentinels use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.


### Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence,
and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or
tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance,
and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

__Deception__. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, or dull someone's suspicions with false assurances.

__*Intimidation*__. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

__*Performance*__. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

__*Persuasion*__. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a politician to let your party see the councilor, negotiating peace between warring krogan tribes, or inspiring a crowd of colonist.

__*Other Charisma Checks*__. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
  - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
  - Blend into a crowd to get a sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability
Asari and some sentinels Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving
throw DCs of spells they cast.

## Saving Throws
A __saving throw__ - also called a save - represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a
similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or
monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity
modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage,
as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The engineer, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves.
As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving
throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving
throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a
successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
