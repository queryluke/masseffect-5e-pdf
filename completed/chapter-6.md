# Chapter 6: Customization Options
The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the 
personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have 
options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players—with the GM’s permission—want to go a step further. This 
chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you 
combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain 
levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign. 

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to
realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining
a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For
example, if you have three levels in engineer and two in sentinel, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another
class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start
progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some
focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your
new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a vanguard who decides to multiclass into
the infiltrator class must have both Dexterity and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training
that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites

|<span style='font-size: 11px;'>Class</span>|<span style='font-size: 11px;'>Ability Score Minimum</span>|
|:---|:---|
|Adept|Wisdom 13|
|Engineer|Intelligence 13|
|Infiltrator|Dexterity 13 and Intelligence 13|
|Sentinel|Intelligence 13 or Wisdom 13|
|Soldier|Strength 13 or Dexterity 13|
|Vanguard|Strength 13 and Wisdom 13|


```
```

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character
Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are an engineer 6/adept 1, you must gain enough XP
to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as an adept or your seventh level as an engineer.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a
class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same
die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the sentinel and the soldier have a d10, so if you are a
sentinel 5/soldier 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them
separately. If you are a sentinel 5/vanguard 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d12 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example,
if you are a soldier 3/infiltrator 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting
proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies

|<div style='width: 80px; font-size: 11px;'>Class</div>|<span style='font-size: 11px;'>Proficiencies Gained</span>|
|:---|:---|
|Adept|SMGs|
|Engineer|Assault Rifles, Medium Armor|
|Infiltrator|Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons|
|Sentinel|Medium Armor, Heavy Armor, and choose 1 weapon type from Assault Rifles, Melee, Shotguns, or SMGs|
|Soldier|2 weapon types, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor|
|Vanguard|Shotguns, Medium Armor|

### Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's
starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Barrier, Extra Attack, and Spellcasting.

#### Barrier
Your barrier capacity depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your
individual levels in those classes. You determine your barrier capacity by adding together all your levels in the
vanguard class and half your levels (rounded down) in the adept and sentinel classes. Use this total to determine your
barrier capacity by consulting the Multiclass Barrier table.

##### Multiclass Barrier: 
##### Barrier Ticks per Level

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make
more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the soldier's version of Extra Attack does).

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your 
individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. 
If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

__Spells known and prepared.__ You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually as if you were 
a single-classed member of that class. If you are an adept 4/engineer 3, for example, you know six 1st-level adept spells 
and five adept cantrips based on your levels in the adept class. As a 3rd-level engineer, you can prepare 3 engineer spells. 
If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six engineer spells.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
class when you cast the spell.

You can only use spell slots to cast biotic spells and you can only use tech points to cast tech spells. The exception
is Sentinels that can use their spell slots to cast biotic or tech spells.

__Spell Slots.__ You determine your available spell slots and cantrips by adding together all your levels in the adept class 
and half your levels (rounded down) in the sentinel and vanguard classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots and 
cantrips by consulting the Multiclass Biotics table.

##### Multiclass Biotics:

__Tech Points & Tech Point Limit.__ You determine your tech points and tech point limit by adding together all
your levels in the engineer class and half your levels (rounded down) in the infiltrator class. Use this
total to determine your tech points and memory by consulting the Multiclassing Tech table.

## Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, 
experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. This section provides a list of available and unavailable feats
from D&D 5th Edition's _Player's Handbook_ as well as some new feats for the Mass Effect universe.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo 
taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description 
says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use 
that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

```

### Card Shark
_Prerequisite: Charisma 12 or higher_
___
You've sunk considerable time into playing cards for credits in seedy dives and upscale casinos alike, and, through 
countless wins and losses, you've honed your gamesmanship into a thing of beauty. You gain the following benefits and features:

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with two types of gaming sets of your choice.
- You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to bluff opponents in games of chance and Charisma (Persuasion) checks to convince others to join you for a game.

### Come Get Me
Conventional wisdom in combat is to avoid being targeted. You prefer an alternate school of thought, keeping enemies 
focused on you and off of your less stalwart allies.

- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. 
- As an action, you can make a feint to draw enemy attention. This feint may be a war cry, a loud insult, or a different distraction. All enemies within 16 meters must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a successful saving throw, a target is unaffected and is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. On a failed saving throw, an enemy has disadvantage on attacking any creature except you for the next minute, or until they make an attack against you. You may use this ability once per short or long rest.


### Cranial Bruiser
_Prerequisite: Krogan_
___
Krogan are notorious for using any weapon within reach - even the armored plates that cover their foreheads. 
- You can attack with a headbutt, which is a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.
- When you use the Dash action during your turn, you can make a melee attack with your headbutt as a bonus action.

  style='width:160px; position: absolute; left: 130px' />

```
```
### Enhanced Optics
Your optic nerves have been enhanced by science to perceive more.
- Gain darkvision.
- You now gain proficiency in Perception, Investigation, and Insight. If you are already proficient in any of these, gain expertise instead.

### Featherlight
_Prerequisite: Dexterity 12 or higher_
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- If you are wearing all light armor (or no armor) and have only one weapon equipped, your speed increases by 4m and you avoid triggering any pressure-activated traps or mines.


### Grace Under Fire
While others may lose their cool in the face of sustaining a wound, you've learned how to use that burst of pain and 
stress to move faster. You gain the following benefits and features:
- Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Immediately after you receive damage from an enemy attack, you may use your reaction to move up to half your movement without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Grenadier
_Prerequisite: Dexterity or Strength 12 or higher_
___
When you use a grenade, you may choose to make a ranged weapon attack (10/30m) on a creature instead of choosing a target location.
Add your dexterity or strength modifier (your choice) and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the grenade
deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + dexterity or strength modifier (same as used to make the ranged attack). The target
also has disadvantage on the saving throw caused by the grenade. The grenade lands at the target's location.
On a miss, the grenade lands 2m beyond the target. On a critical miss, roll 2d4. The first die represents the number of
spaces away from the target in which the grenade lands. The second die represents the direction (1 = North, 2= East,
3 = South, 4 = West). E.g., 2 & 2, the grenade would land 2 spaces east of the target. Once the grenade's location is
determined, it resolves normally.

- +2 grenade capacity
- __Improvised Grenades__. You can make grenades from scrap metal and scavenged materials. Acquire 1 frag grenade every long rest. The Mark of the frag grenade is equal to your level divided by three, minimum 1.




### Hair-Trigger
_Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher_
- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When wielding only one Double Tap weapon, you may make a second ranged attack on the same target as your first ranged attack as a free action. You may do this once per turn.
- When you use your bonus action or free action to make a ranged attack with a Double Tap weapon, you add your ability modifier to the damage roll.


### Nerves of Steel
___
Traveling the galaxy has exposed you to violence and cruelty, been deceived and seen almost every trick in the book. Not 
much can make you flinch anymore. You gain the following benefits and features:
- You have advantage on all saving throws made to resist becoming charmed, frightened, and stunned.
- While charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can use a bonus action on your turn to repeat the saving throw to end the 
  effect. This saving throw is not made with advantage.

```
```

### Squad Leader
You know just what to say in a tight situation.

As a bonus action, you can inspire all allies within earshot to instantly roll a hit die and regain that many hit
points. This does not expend a hit die from their pool. Allies immediately recover from the following
conditions: _charmed_, _frightened_, _incapacitated_, _paralyzed_, _poisoned_, _prone_, _restrained_, and _stunned_. You
may use this ability once per long rest.

  style='width:175px; margin: 50px' />

### Warlord's Blood Rage
_Prerequisite: Krogan_
___
Your blood rage is exceptionally deadly, rivaling those of the krogan warlords in Tuchanka. You gain the 
following benefits while using your Blood Rage trait:
- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either total.
- As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.
- When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one additional damage dice and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.


### Wealth of Knowledge
_Prerequisite: Intelligence 13 or higher_
- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on the first Intelligence-based skill check you make after a short rest.
