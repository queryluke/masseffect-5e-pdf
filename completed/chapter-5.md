# Chapter 5: Equipment

The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: armories and weaponsmiths, tailors and jewelers,  armor and weapon mod shots, not to mention bars, brothels, and other seedy locations. In the largest cities on the more
civilized planets (and especially in the Citadel), almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to multimedia and civilian transports. For an operative, the availability of armor, weapons, themal clips, grenades, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death during a covert mission or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and technologically advanced merchandise that operatives commonly find useful in the face of galactic threats.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively,
you can start with a number of credits based on your race and spend them on items from the lists in this section and appendicies. See chapter 2 for more information on using racial starting credits.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance or goods that the
character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as
part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from
generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

##### Starting Wealth by Race

| Races | Credits |
| :--- | ---: |
| Asari, krogan | (10d4 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Human, quarian, turian | (8d6 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Elcor, volus | (10d6 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Angara, batarian, drell, hanar | (6d8 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Geth, prothean | (2d10 x 1,000) + 10,000 |
| Salarian, vorcha | (4d12 x 1,000) + 10,000 |


## Wealth
Wealth appears in many forms in a Mass Effect 5e galaxy. Credits, precious metals, trade goods, art objects, animals, and
property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the lower classes trade in goods, bartering for
what they need and paying taxes in all aspects of life.

Members of the upper-class trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mining facility, an asteroid point, or
land on an eezo rich planet or in equipment and tech, measuring tech by profitability rather than the credits. Only
shopkeepers, operatives, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.

<br>

> #### Currency
> __Credits__ are the only type of currency in Mass Effect. The guideline conversion rate from D&D 5th Edition to Mass
Effect 5e is:
> ##### 1 gp = ~100 credits

<br>

### Selling Items

Opportunities abound to find tech, gadgets, equipment, weapons, armor, and more throughout the galaxy. Normally, you can
sell your bounty when you return to a civilized planet or spaceport, provided that you can find buyers, entrepreneurs, and
fencers interested in your loot.

__Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.__
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons
and armor used by mercenaries are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Instead, you may opt to break these items down
into _omni-gel_.

__Gems, Jewelry, Art Objects, and Artifacts__.
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency
for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or
larger community first.

__Trade Goods and Other__.
On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods - bars of
raw metal, chemicals, livestock, omni-gel, and so on - retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

#### Discounts
Longtime Mass Effect players will certainly want to reference Shepard's ability to secure discounts from local shops. One option
is to have players make Intimidation or Persuasion checks (with or without Paragon/Renegade scores). However, for
added variety and randomness, you can use the following set of rules.

First, assign a DC to your shopkeeper. The DC could be equal for Intimidation and Persuasion, or it could be different for each.

Next, have you player make an Intimidation or Persuasion check. If using Paragon/Renegade rule, they can add their Renegade modifier to
Intimidation checks or Paragon modifier for Persuasion checks. The result of this check adds a modifier to the final d100 roll (see next step).

| If the player... | Their modifier is... |
|:--- | :---: |
| rolls a critical failure | -50 |
| fails the check | -20 |
| succeeds on the check | +20 |
| rolls a critical success | +50 |

<div class='wide descriptive'>
 
##### Discount Resolution

Finally, the GM or player rolls a d100 adding the modifier from the previous step. Consult the following table for the resolution.

<div style='width: 60px;'>d100</div> | Result
:---: | :---
<= 10 | The shopkeeper is furious that you would attempt to cheat them out of their wares. They will not do business with you or your party.
11-30 | The shopkeeper sees through your ruse. If you're going to play it that way, you'll have to pay 10% more.
31-50 | The shopkeeper is unmoved. They aren't going to give you a discount, but they're not shutting their doors either.
51-70 | The shopkeeper has seen these ploys before, but you gave him a good chuckle, for that, you get a 10% discount.
71-90 | Better to work with you than against you, the shopkeeper offers you a 20% discount.
>= 91 | Either completely enthralled with your proposal, or scared out of their wits, the shopkeeper offers you a one-item discount of 50% off, and a lifetime discount of 20% off.

</div>

## Armor

To survive in the galaxy, your character needs to wear armor. Not only does armor abate damage from extremely powerful,
futuristic weapons but armor also supplies __shield points__, also called shields (outlined below). Luckily, almost all
garments in the mass effect world provide some form of protection. Diaphanous night-gowns can even provide a modicum of
protection. Thus, in Mass Effect 5e, almost all operatives are wearing armor and are afforded shield points, unless the player
or GM explicitly states your character is not wearing armor.

__Armor Proficiency__. Just like 5th edition, anyone can put on armor. However, only those proficient in the armor type
know how to wear it effectively. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor (light, medium, or heavy).
If you are wearing 2 or more pieces of armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,
saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. If you are wearing 4 pieces of armor you lack
proficiency with, you cannot cast spells.

__Armor Class (AC)__. Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear determines your base Armor Class.

__Shield Points__. All armor chest pieces
provide some amount of shield points. See _Shields_ in chapter 9 for more information.


### Mix & Match
Unlike D&D 5th edition, armor in Mass Effect 5e can be mixed between armor placements on the body. There are 4 armor placements:
__Head__, __Chest__, __Arms__, and __Legs__.

Your base AC is 10 and each piece of armor provides an AC bonus depending on its type and placement as listed in
the Armor / AC bonuses table. Additionally, there are bonuses and limitations for the combination of armor types you are wearing,
explained in the Armor Bonuses and Limitations table.

__Heavier Armor__. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the 
Armor Bonuses and Limitations table shows “Str 12” or “Str 16” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor 
reduces the wearer’s speed by 4m unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

For simplicity's sake, you cannot mix armor *within* placements. I.e., you cannot have a heavy piece of on your right arm
and a light piece of armor on your left.

<br>

>#### Variant: Encumbrance
>If you are using the _Variant: Encumbrance_ rules,
>use the Armor Piece Weights table to determine the total weight of the armor you're wearing.
>
>|Placement/Type|Light|Medium|Heavy
>|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
>|Chest|3kg|6kg|10kg|
>|Arms|1kg|2kg|3kg|
>|Legs|1kg|2kg|3kg|
>__Head__. All headware weights 2kg

___Body Armor_ is considered three pieces (arms, chest, and legs)__

</div>


### Armor Sets
Most armor you buy in the galaxy has been mass-produced, these are called __armor sets__. A set is not required to be
multiple pieces of armor. For example, the Capacitor Helmet is a single piece of head armor. The unique aspect of armor
sets is that they have benefits and attributes that are pre-installed due to their mass-production. Thus, you cannot
customize armor sets with armor mods and you cannot salvage a beneficial aspect from an armor set.

Armor sets have an armor type (light, medium, or heavy) which you use for calculating your character's AC.

A full list of armor sets can be found in Appendix A.

#### Body Armor
Body Armor is a special type of armor piece that consists of 3 pieces of armor: Chest, Arms, and Legs. Body 
armor is completely integrated (all or none), therefore, you cannot swap out pieces from other sets. I.e., if you're 
wearing the Duelist body armor, you cannot replace the legs from it with the Lockdown Greaves. This rule is, of course, flexible,
as GMs might allow this type of tinkering in exchange for time, credits, and/or skill checks. 

#### Set Bonuses
Set bonuses are additional benefits you receive from wearing multiple pieces from the same set, signifying the armors
component pieces working together for a unified integration. Armor with the same base name is part of a set, e.g. __Colossus__ _[item]_. 

```
```

You only receive the benefit once per set and the benefit ends immediately if you fall below the threshold. For example, 
if a set provides:

##### Medium Armor
- __Set Bonus (2 of 4)__: +1 AC 
- __Set Bonus (4 of 4)__: +1 AC

If you are wearing the head and chest pieces, you gain +0 AC from the helmet and +2 AC from the chest piece (as calculated using the Armor / AC table). In addition you gain +1 AC from wearing 2 pieces of the set.

Note, you _do not_ gain +1 AC for the head _and_ +1 AC for the chest. As soon as you remove either the helmet or the chest piece, you loose the +1 AC bonus.


### Environmental Protection
All armor provides basic environmental protection from the vacuum of space or hazardous atmospheres. Armor supplies enough
air and heat to the wearer for 8 hours of activity or 16 hours if the operative remains motionless. Your GM may require
that your character wear a helmet to gain this benefit, or they may use the __bubble rule__ and claim that all armor suits
can cast an energy "bubble" around your characters head to keep air in and the environment out.


<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>



\page

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

__Don__. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

__Doff__. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

##### Donning and Doffing Armor
Category | Don | Doff
:--- | :---: | :---:
Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute
Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute
Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes

### Customizing Armor

For characters that want to create unique armor, they can craft or purchase upgradable armor pieces. To craft armor, your character needs to be proficient with Armorsmith's or Tailor's tools. Then they must spend the necessary
amount of time and omni-gel as listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table. Note that it takes much less time and resources to craft
these basic armor pieces than it does to craft armor sets due to the simplicity of the armor your character is creating.

Characters may instead purchase customizable armor for the cost listed in the Customizable Armor Costs table.

Once you have crafted or purchased your armor piece, it is time to add benefits to the armor using __armor mods__. Each
piece of customizable armor has a set number of mod slots and you can add additional slots (up to the maximum) for more
time and omni-gel (if crafting) or credits (if purchasing). You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest,
head, legs, or arms.

A full list of Armor Mods can be found in Appendix B.

#### Rewarding Custom Armor
Your GM might reward you with a custom piece of armor that you've looted or found during a mission. When you are rewarded
with a custom piece of armor, make sure you write down how many total mod slots the piece has and what armor mods are
currently installed.

<br>

> ##### Example Armor Creation
> Imogen wants to create a fancy chest piece for her character Tiiva. She wants to add another mod slot for a
maximum of 3 armor mods. Tiiva spends 4 long rests (8 hours in each rest) and 20 omni-gel to create a medium piece of
chest armor. 
>
>Alternatively, she could have spent 30,000 credits to purchase the armor piece.
>
>Next Imogen spends 30,000 credits
on the ablative coating mod. She also looted an asymmetric defense layer mod from a previous
mission. She spends 2 more long rests applying those mods, giving her chest armor resistance to piercing damage
and +2 AC. She leaves her third slot empty for the time being, hoping to loot another mod and fit it in later.

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to
use. Whether you favor an assault rifle or a sword, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the
difference between life and death while on a mission.

Appendix C has the full list of available weapons, their price and weight, the damage
they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged.
A __melee__ weapon is used to attack a target within 2 meters of you, whereas a __ranged__ weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

<br>

> ##### Melee and Heat
> In Mass Effect 5e, melee weapons are considered to be one weapon type, and ranged weapons are divided by their gun type.
>
> __Melee__. while there are fewer options for melee weapons and the damage is somewhat less, all melee weapons and melee attacks by-pass shield points. This is explained further in the _Shields_ section of chapter 9.
>
> __Heat__. Almost all ranged weapons have heat which is the number of times a weapon can be fired before it must be reloaded. If the weapon has a heat of 1 and you fire it, you must reload the weapon with a fresh thermal clip before firing it again. Reloading takes an action.

<br>

### Weapon Proficiency
You must be proficient with a weapon type to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. There are 7 distinct weapon
types and all weapons fall into one of the following types.

___
- __Assault Rifles__. The most common weapons of the military. These are generally medium-range weapons that deal average damage with a high heat capacity.
- __Heavy Pistols__. The most common gun type in the Mass Effect universe. Simple but effective.
- __Sub-machine Guns (SMGs)__. Single-handed, rapid fire weapons that have a short range.
- __Shotguns__. Close-range, high-damage blasts.
- __Sniper Rifles__. Precision instruments meant for long range or stealthy combat.
- __Melee__. Used in close-quarters combat. _Damage resulting from melee weapon attacks by-pass shields_.
- __Heavy Weapons__. Specialty weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. _Heavy Weapons do not have a proficiency requirement_.

  style='width:325px; position: absolute; bottom: 20px; left: 50px' />


```
```

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in Appendix C.

___
- __Arc.__ Deals lightning damage. On a hit, deals half of the damage dealt to 1 additional creature within 2m of the hit target. If there is more than one creature within 2m of the initial target, choose the second target randomly.
- __Burst Fire.__ Can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 4m-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This action uses 3 heat.
- __Double Tap.__ When you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you can use your bonus action to make a second ranged attack. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. The second attack may be on the same or a different target.
- __Finesse__. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- __Heavy__. Requires a minimum Strength score of 15. Creatures with a Strength score lower than 15 have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons as its size and bulk is to cumbersome to use effectively.
- __Hip Fire.__ When making a ranged attack on a target creature within 2m, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- __Light.__ A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
- __Range.__ A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in meters, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
- __Reach.__ This weapon adds 2 meters to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
- __Recoil.__ A weapon with the Recoil property generates a lot of kickback when fired. You use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- __Silent.__ Makes no noise when used to make an attack roll.
- __Special.__ A weapon with the special property generally has unusual rules governing its use explained in the weapon notes. Additionally, special weapons cannot be improved by weapon mods.
- __Two-handed.__	This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. Takes up 2 weapon slots.
- __Thrown.__ If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
- __Versatile__. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.




<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\page

#### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes
any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a crowbar, or the arm of a geth.


Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to
a club (melee weapon). At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were
that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).
If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property,
it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 6 meters and a long range of 18 meters. Light improvised thrown weapons have ranges of 10m and 30m, and heavy improvised ranged weapons have ranges of 4m and 12m.


#### Heavy Weapons 
Heavy Weapons use Charges to track the number of times they can be fired. If you run out of Charges your weapon is nothing more than a hunk of metal.

__Targeting.__ Most heavy weapons require the Targeting condition to use. Targeting means painting the battlefield or keeping a lock on one or more creatures for a single round of combat. More information about targeting can be found in appendix G.


### Carrying, Holstering, and Drawing Weapons
You have 4 weapon slots unless a feature or armor mod allows you to have more. _Two-handed_ weapons take up 2 slots.

If using the Variant: Encumbrance rule, you can carry as many weapons as your carry capacity will allow.

You can holster one weapon you're wielding or draw one weapon you're carrying as a free action. This is true for all weapon types.
However, to holster one weapon *then* draw a second weapon would require an action.
But the GM might allow a Sleight of Hand check to see if you can holster and draw at the cost of your bonus action.

## Mods

Armor and weapon mods allow you to upgrade your equipment, providing powerful bonuses. All mods have their
own costs. Operatives who are proficient with Tinker's tools can craft mods but most can be purchased from your local equipment shop. Once you've acquired your mod, you can install it yourself (if you're proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or Weaponsmith's tools) or you can have an equipment shop install it for you.

```
```

### Removing Mods
In general, mods cannot be removed. Those proficient with Armorsmith's, Tailor's, or Weaponsmith's tools may attempt to
salvage mods at the risk of destroying the weapon or piece of armor and all other installed mods. Equipment shops around the galaxy typically won't offer this service for fear of a lawsuit.

### Armor Mods
Installing armor mods requires you to craft or purchase a piece of customizable armor. See
the Custom Armor section above. Each piece of customizable armor
has a set number of mod slots. You must select a mod with a matching armor piece, i.e. chest, head, legs, or arms.

A full list of armor mods can be found in appendix B.

### Weapon Mods
Weapons are only allowed one mod per slot. For example, the M-8 Avenger cannot have the Ultralight Materials and the
Precision Scope, because both of those mods utilize the Body slot. 

Some mods are limited by weapon type. For example, the Stunner mod is only available for placement on Heavy Pistols and SMGs. 

Finally, you cannot add weapon mods to any weapon with the _special_ property.

___
- __Ranged weapon mod slots.__ _Magazine_, _Body_, _Ammo_, and _Barrel_.
- __Melee weapon mod slots.__ _Grip_, and _Strike_.

A full list of weapon mods can be found in appendix D.

## Mission Critical Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

### Thermal Clips
Thermal Clips weren't in use until about 2184. Depending on when you set your campaign, this presents a discrepancy in
the timeline. Your GM may choose to overlook this fact and continue with the thermal clip rules, or use the _Variant: Venting_ rule.

___
- __Use.__ When you reload your weapon, you expend a thermal clip.
- __Capacity: 10.__ All armor comes standard with 10 thermal clip slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: ~100 credits__. Thermal clips are easily looted from almost every enemy wielding a weapon. However, you can also resupply all of your thermal clips at a gun shop or military depot for about 100 credits. However, because thermal clips are so easily attainable, GMs might find it more manageable to simply not keep track of thermal clips and assume players will always have a steady supply available to them.


<br>

> ##### History of Thermal Clips
>It was discovered that, in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most
rounds downrange the fastest. As such, detachable heat sinks, known as thermal clips, were adopted first by the geth,
and shortly thereafter by organic arms manufacturers. Ammunition may never be a concern with modern arms, but the
availability of thermal clips is; weapons without thermal clips have nowhere to disperse their heat and are incapable of
firing. Luckily, thermal clips litter modern battlefields and can be obtained from fallen enemies or found around the
environment.


<img 
  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/f/f3/ME3_Upgrade_Sniper_Rifle_Spare_Thermal_Clip.png/revision/latest?cb=20120315143250' 
  style='width:225px; position: absolute; left: 100px' />
  
<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

#### Variant: Venting
Instead of thermal clips, each weapon's heat indicates the number of times it can be fired before it overheats. Replace any reference to __Reloading__ with __Venting__. Venting works exactly the same as reloading, taking some amount of time to vent the weapons heat (instead of reloading a thermal clip).

If a weapon is not fired for a full round of combat, it naturally regains 1 heat. Additionally, any weapon that is at
0 heat can be fired, but it automatically jams and cannot be used until after a long rest.




### Heavy Weapon Charges
Heavy weapons require _charges_ to be used. A charge is a generic term that can refer to a missile, energy source, or
raw material.
___
- __Resupplying: ~5,000 credits.__ If you've got your hands on a heavy weapon, you're either a military specialist or damn lucky you survived the battle. It's not easy resupplying your charges. You'll need to have some serious military or black market connections. If military, you might get special permission to keep the weapon and granted a steady stream of charges (once per long rest). That's between you and your Galaxy Master. Otherwise, you'll have to pay a pretty penny on the black-market to recharge your Heavy Weapon (5,000-7,000 credits for a complete resupply of charges). In most cases, it's easier to scavenge or steal ammo. Or simply leave the damn thing where you found it.


### Grenades & Mines
Grenades and mines provide various types of explosive mechanics to use in the heat of combat.
___
- __Use.__ Using a grenade is the same as using an item, requiring one Action.
- __Capacity: 2.__ All armor comes standard with 2 grenade slots. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: ~500 credits per grenade.__ Grenades are a military resource, so, depending on your campaign setting they might be an uncommon or rare item. If your character is part of a military outfit, you can resupply every time you return to base (or to your ship). Otherwise, finding grenades may be a bit more difficult, requiring you to barter, steal, or loot them. A recommended cost is 500-1000 credits per grenade or mine.

Appendix E has a full list of available grenades.

#### Higher Marks
Grenades and Mines can range in power from Mark I to Mark X. Each grenade description describes the effect of higher marks.
It is recommended that each higher mark costs at least 1.5 times more credits than the previous mark: 

##### Recommended Cost per Grenade
| Mark | Credits |
| :---: | :---: |
| I | 500 |
| II | 750 |
| III | 1,250 |
| IV | 1,800 |
| V | 2,500 |

### Medi-gel
Medi-gel (medical gel) is an all-purpose medicinal salve combining an anaesthetic and clotting agent used by paramedics,
EMTs, and military personnel, produced by the Sirta Foundation. It heals various wounds and ailments, instantly sealing
injuries against infection and allowing for rapid healing by having the gel grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency
of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids - most notably blood - as well as contaminants and gases.

___
- __Use.__ As an action, use a medi-gel pack on yourself or a willing creature within 2m. The target regains hit points equal to the medi-gel's potency as listed in the Medi-gel Types table.
- __Capacity: 4.__ All armor comes standard with a capacity for 4 medi-gel. Some armor and mods allow you to increase this amount.
- __Resupplying: varies.__ As long as you're in a relatively civilized environment, you can easily resupply your medi-gel at a medical facility. However, you would need insider or black-market connections to get Superior or Ultimate medi-gel. Since Ultimate medi-gel is so rare, the cost is entirely dependent on the people you know, favors your owed, or ability to break into a medical facility.

##### Medi-gel Types
| Type | Rarity | Cost | HP Regained |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Standard | Common | ~200 credits | 2d4 + 2 |
| Enhanced | Uncommon | ~500 credits | 4d4 + 4 |
| Superior | Rare | ~1,500 credits | 8d4 + 8 |
| Ultimate | Very Rare | ? | 10d4 + 20 |


### Omni-gel
Omni-gel is a technological material that can be obtained by breaking down unwanted items, such as weapons, armor, and
upgrades. Doing so will usually give an amount of omni-gel based on the item that was dismantled.

Omni-gel is composed of common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys kept in a semi-molten state.
It is designed for use with omni-tools to do electronics and decryption work, make general repairs, and even craft new upgrades.
Each canister of omni-gel is stored in a canister and is worth 1,000 credits.

##### Omni-gel Yield
| Equipment | Yield |
| :--- | :--- |
| Armor & Weapon Mods, Tools & Kits | 1 |
| Heavy Pistols, SMGs, and Head, Leg, and Arm armor | 3 |
| Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, and Chest Armor | 6 |
| Heavy Weapon | 10 |

  style='width:280px' />

### Omni-tool Programs

Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack, and minifacturing fabricator.
The fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics,
ceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the
reuse of salvaged equipment.

Most omni-tools come with a standard set of functionality, including scanning, remote interfacing, and some fabricator
designs.  However, there exist in the galaxy a number of advanced omni-tool programs that are not available for the general
population's consumption. These programs tend to be of military design, experimental hacks or deprecated programs
that have been scrubbed from the exonet.

For a full list of Omni-tool programs, see appendix F.

#### Installation

Some omni-tool programs require an operative to integrate the module into the tool's microframe before the benefits can
be used. This process is called Installation, and certain programs have a prerequisite for it.

Installation requires an operative to spend a short rest focused on only installing and debugging the program. If the short
rest is interrupted, the installation attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the operative gains the
benefits of the program.

A program can be installed to only one omni-tool at a time. Almost all programs come with a powerful DRM and security
system that prevents the program being installed on multiple omni-tools or replicated. Interestingly,
before the humans were granted an embassy on the Citadel in 2165, the concept of digital rights management was foreign to
the other races of the galaxy. But since 2165, omni-tool programs have been locked down. Attempting to hack the DRM
generally has a terrible result.

An omni-tool can only have three programs activated at once. Any attempt to install to a fourth program fails; the operative
must first uninstall the program from their tool (this also takes a short rest). Once uninstalled, the program can be
traded and installed on a separated tool. Additionally, omni-tools can't have more than one copy of a program installed.

#### Single-Use Programs

Manufacturers and militaries quickly realized it was much easier, cheaper, faster, and (usually) safer to send bits of
data rather than physical products, and let fabricators generate the devices on site using generic materials, like omni-gel.
After the advent of omni-tools, a number of industries used this method to ship their products. However, to avoid
unauthorized replication, the programs would scrub themselves once the job was complete.

Omni-tool programs that don't require installation are single-use and cost a number of omni-gel to create the final product.
Once used, the program is completely wiped. As with installed programs, attempts to recreate these pieces of code can be
costly, even deadly.

#### Unstable Programs

Unstable Programs are entirely experimental, therefore the number of times you can run the program varies widely. In some
cases, unstable programs are single-use programs that are hacked for multiple uses. A GM can create an Unstable Program
from a Single-Use program by assigning a die roll (d4, d6, etc) to the number of times the program can be used.


## Tools & Kits

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or hack
a security system. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a
tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to
a single ability since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

### Tool Proficiency

Mass Effect 5e utilizes the Tool Proficiency rules found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78). In summary, it's
unclear when a player should use a tool proficiency and a skill proficiency. The rule of thumb is that tools have
specific applications whereas skills are very broad, but this limits the use of tools.

Thus, to make tool proficiencies more attractive, Xanathar's Guide to Everything added benefits to combining tools with
skills. The first is that combining a tool with a skill gives the player advantage when making the skill check.
The second benefit is that tools provide additional non-combat features.

__Advantage or Added Benefit__. When the character combines their tool proficiency with a skill, they gain _additional insight_ 
which means the operative either gains advantage on the skill check or they can gain an added benefit, decided by the GM. 

For example, a character that is proficient with Hacking Tools gains advantage when combining their tool proficiency
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check when utilizing networked systems (like the exonet) or they might gain
an added benefit, such as finding some additional information or key codes.

__Unique Skill__. Operatives proficient in a tool have a unique activity they can perform during a short or long rest.
For example, a character proficient with Armorsmith's Workbench can craft armor or attempt to remove mods. 

__Sample Activities__. Each tool also has sample activity DCs. These are examples and not an exhaustive list. GMs can adjust
DCs or create new activities as they see fit. These activities require a skill check, but the skill used is up to the GM.
For example, an operative proficient with hacking tools can disable a security system. This would likely require an
Intelligence (Electronics) check, but if the security system required splicing wires, it might require a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check instead.

## Expenses

When not infiltrating an enemy's base, exploring prothean ruins or unknown planets, or waging war against the encroaching reaper threat, operatives face more mundane realities. Even in the sci-fi world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in the galaxy. They cover your
accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your
equipment so you can be ready when mission next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Lifestyle Expenses table and pay the price to
sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over
a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the
rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

##### Lifestyle Expenses
|Lifestyle|Credits/Day|
|:--- | :---: |
|Wretched|-|
|Squalid|25 credits|
|Poor|75 credits|
|Modest|150 credits|
|Comfortable|250 credits|
|Wealthy | 500 credits|
|Aristocratic|1,000 credits minimum|

__Wretched__. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into
transit tunnels, huddling in alleyways, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
people covet your armor, weapons, and gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice
of most people.

__Squalid__. You live in the slums, a condemned building, a repurposed shipping container, or a roach-infested boarding
house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you
have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be
disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

__Poor__. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,
threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your
accommodations might be a room in a rundown apartment, the basement dwelling of a business, or the bunker of a faction.
You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

__Modest__. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in
an older part of the city, renting a room in a crowded apartment. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living
conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students,
service workers.

__Comfortable__. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your
equipment. You live in a nice apartment in a middle-class neighborhood or in a small townhouse. You associate with
shopkeepers, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

__Wealthy__. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social
status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly
successful small business owner, a politician, or a doctor. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a
good part of town or a comfortable suite at the top level of an apartment building. You likely have a small staff of workers
to maintain your home or run day to day errands.

__Aristocratic__. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in
the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a mansion in the nicest part of town or a luxurious suite. You dine
at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have workers attending to your every need.
You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful and spend evenings in the company of politicians,
community leaders, and other elite persons. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The
wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

>##### Self Sufficiency
>
>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures on an advanced planet
in a city or town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford - paying for food and lodging, paying
skilled workers to mend your armor or service your weapons, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend
their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
>
>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your
time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in
Survival the skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.
