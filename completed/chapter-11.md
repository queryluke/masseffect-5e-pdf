 The Gunship is driven by vectored-thrust engines. First rolled off the assembly lines in 2170, the Mantis remains in
service in dozens of armies across the galaxy. Its modular construction means that the versatile Mantis can be
reconfigured as a low-altitude gunship, a fighter, a high-altitude bomber, or even a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane
that can engage enemy craft around a planet or a space station. The only role the Mantis cannot perform is that of a true
deep-space fighter, as it has no FTL drive.

This vehicle statblock represents the most basic model of the A-61. But it can carry a number of weapons load-outs. When
used in ground-attack roles it is most commonly armed with two sets of two forward-facing missile bays over each wing,
normally armed with Inferno PKRs (Precision Kill Rockets), and a pair of belly-mounted M350 mass-accelerator autocannons.

 The M-080 is a large infantry fighting vehicle (IFV). This class of vehicle is equipped with a turret with two
coaxial barrels: the machine gun and main cannon. Like the M29 Grizzly and the M35 Mako, the M-080 is equipped with six wheels.

 The M-44 Hammerhead is an infantry fighting vehicle that hovers over the battlefield at up to 120 kilometers an hour.
It most likely follows a theme of naming armored vehicles after sharks, just like the M35 Mako.

 The M35 Mako infantry fighting vehicle was designed for the Systems Alliance's frigates. It is designed to fulfill the
role of rapid deployment that its predecessor, the M29 Grizzly, fell short of accomplishing. Though the interior is
cramped, an M35 is small enough to be carried in the cargo bay and easily deployed on virtually any world.

 The UT-47 Kodiak Drop Shuttle is a personnel carrier capable of planetary flight and is capable of limited FTL travel.
The shuttle is used extensively by (but not limited to) the Systems Alliance and Cerberus in 2186. The Kodiak and
several variants have also seen extensive use in the Andromeda Galaxy's Heleus Cluster by the Andromeda Initiative
nearly 600 years later.

 Referred to colloquially as a "shuttle", "skycar", or "aircar", the X3M is a contragravity speeder designed for
transporting individuals in metropolises and space stations. Shuttles are compartmentalized into a pilot/passenger
compartment and a propulsive drive compartment. In the pilot/passenger compartment, there are four seats with one of
them reserved for the pilot. From either the forward left or right seat, a pilot controls the shuttle's movements
through the use of a haptic adaptive interface. The canopy of the shuttle is divided into two sections - a central
section which lifts up, and a clamshell door. The windows of the vehicle can be darkened for the privacy of the
passengers. Due to the limited storage space, passengers are limited to what they can carry or store on their bodies.
To the rear of this compartment, there is the propulsive drive powered by a mass effect field.

X3Ms come in a variety of models. Some are smaller with only 1 or 2 seats like the Tess Auburn 2166 aircar. Models
like the C-111 Skyline Shuttle are meant for public transportation and can carry up to 10 passengers. Some models
are meant for driving enthusiasts with increased handling and acceleration, like the Mark II Blackout or Esquiran
Sporting Shuttle.

 A mix-up during the cruiser's design left it with an unusually large drive core and engineers redesigned the ship
around the excessive power source. The asari cruiser's unusually robust engines provide enough energy to generate kinetic
barriers normally reserved for dreadnoughts.

 The Athabasca Class is a class of large freighter of human origin. Externally, this freighter class's configuration may
be mistaken for the smaller Kowloon Class freighters. However, the Athabasca Class freighter is a multi-level voluminous
starship. The Athabasca Class freighter is lightly armored and lacks armaments, and can be attacked and boarded very
quickly. This freighter class is equipped with a self-destruct device and a black box.

 A strange hybrid of an organic hive and metal, a Collector Ship carries the enigmatic Collectors, a race of 
mysterious beings from beyond the Omega-4 Relay. Their technology is light years more advanced than anything in 
the known galaxy, and their powerful ships are no exception.

 Kowloon Class vessels are basic freighter starships originally designed (and mostly used) by humans. Each ship is
built on a standard design, likely for easy mass production. They generally carry a large cargo bay with smaller
compartments for additional passenger haulage, but their design means these compartments can be swapped or exchanged to
customize the ship.

Kowloon-class ships are hardy but carry no armaments and only a standard engine core. Unfortunately, this makes them easy
prey for privateers or mercenary bands looking for a quick score. Most are given the prefix 'MSV', for 'merchant space vehicle'.

 The SSV Normandy SR-1 (__S__ystems Alliance __S__pace __V__ehicle __Normandy__ __S__tealth __R__econnaissance-1) was a
Systems Alliance starship. She is a prototype "deep scout" frigate, first of the eponymous Normandy class, co-developed
by the Alliance and the Turian Hierarchy with the sponsorship of the Citadel Council. She is optimized for solo
reconnaissance missions deep within unstable regions, using state-of-the-art stealth technology powered by an experimental drive core.

 Also known as Sovereign-class, the two-kilometer-long Capital Ships are the most well-known Reaper subtype. Their main
weapon is a spinal mounted "magnetohydrodynamic" cannon with a yield of 132 to 450 kilotons of TNT, which dwarfs the
main gun of an Everest-class Alliance dreadnought. No known ship, not even a dreadnought, has been known to survive a
hit from this weapon.

 Destroyers are a type of Reaper that appear during their galaxy-wide invasion in 2186. They are approximately 160 meters
in height; smaller than a Reaper of Sovereign's class, which measure over two kilometers in height. Destroyers make up
the majority of the Reaper fleet and are believed to be created using harvested species that are not used to
build Reaper Capital Ships.
