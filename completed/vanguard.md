## Vanguard
Vanguards are feared for their high-risk high-reward combat style, closing quickly on enemies and destroying them at close range with weapons and biotic abilities. They are outfitted with L5n implants, enabling them to perform a biotic charge that strikes the opponent with incredible force while closing distance.

## Class Features

As a vanguard, you gain the following class features

#### Hit Points
___
- __Hit Dice__: 1d12 per vanguard level
- __Hit Points at 1st Level__: 12 + your Constitution modifier
- __Hit Points at Higher Levels__: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per vanguard level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- __Armor__: Light armor, medium armor
- __Weapons__: Heavy Pistols, Melee and choose one from Shotguns or SMGs
- __Tools__: None
- __Saving Throws__: Strength, Wisdom
- __Skills__: Choose three from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand,  and Survival

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- M-3 Predator, M-4 Shuriken,  or M-23 Katana
- Omni-Blade, Omni-Hammer, Monomolecular Blade,  or Riot Shield
- Stock Light Armor or Stock Medium Armor

### Spellcasting

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the vanguard spell list. You learn additional vanguard cantrips of
your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Vanguard table.

Instead of learning a new cantrip, you may instead learn the advanced version of a cantrip you already know.

### Spell Slots
The Vanguard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
vanguard spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell lance and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
cast lance using either slot.

```
```

  style='width:325px' />


### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
Starting at 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the vanguard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Vanguard table shows when you learn more vanguard spells of your choice. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 9th level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you learn a new spell, you may instead choose one of the spells you know and learn an advanced
version of it. You select one of the advancement options listed in the spell description. Whenever you cast the spell,
you cast the advanced version of it. You can only learn one advancement for each spell.

### Spellcasting Ability

Vanguards are outfitted with the L5n biotic implant which draws upon their inner strength of will and focus on their
physical mnemonics. As a vanguard, you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier



### Barrier

As an action or bonus action, you create a biotic barrier around you that reduces incoming damage and fuels certain 
biotic abilities. You gain barrier ticks equal to the Barrier Ticks column shown on your class progression table. You total
barrier ticks cannot exceed the amount listed in the Barrier Ticks column of your class progression table, and any barrier
ticks gained in excess of this number are lost.

</div>

Whenever you would take damage while barrier is active, remove 1 barrier tick and reduce the damage by 1d8. Then, apply
any remaining damage it to other hit pools like tech armor, shields, temporary hit points, or hit points.

Barrier lasts 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or have no barrier ticks remaining. 
You can also end barrier at any time as a free action. When Barrier ends, you lose any remaining barrier ticks.

Once you have used barrier the maximum number of times for your Adept, Sentinel, or Vanguard level (whichever is highest),
you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You may use barrier 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th,
5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.


### Fighting Style

At 1st level, choose a fighting style from the list below.

#### Assault
When you make a Burst Fire attack, the DC of the saving throw is 17.

#### Brawler
Add your proficiency bonus to your melee attack damage rolls.


```
```

#### Carnage
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Close-Quarters Shooter
When making a ranged attack while you are within 2m of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half-cover against targets within 10m of you.

#### Defense
+1 AC

#### Gunslinger
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light ranged weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light ranged weapon that you’re holding in the other hand.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, the damage is reduced by your barrier tick roll.

#### Sniper
If no hostile creature is within 10m of you, gain +2 to damage rolls on attacks made with a sniper rifle.


### Danger Sense

Starting at 2nd, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this 
benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


### Zero-Sum

At 2nd level, when you make a melee attack, instead of rolling a dice, you can flip a coin. On heads, it's a critical hit. On tails, 
it's a critical miss. You can use this ability once per short rest. 



### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you 
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If you are using feats, instead of increasing your ability score(s), you may gain a Feat.


### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Tactical Barrier

At 7th level, whenever you take damage while barrier is active, you choose how many barrier ticks to spend. You may choose to spend 0
barrier ticks.


### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. At 13th level, you can roll two additional damage die. And at 17th level you can roll three additional damage die.


### Heavy Barrier

At 11th level, when you expend a barrier tick to reduce damage, each barrier tick reduces the damage by 3d8.


### Retaliation

At 15th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 2m of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack 
against that creature.

```
```

### Primal Biotics

At 20th level, your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.


## Subclasses
Vanguards have three subclasses which represent their combat style.

### Battle Master

Battle masters use their barrier to execute unique maneuvers on the battlefield, controlling and harrying enemy forces.

#### Biotic Maneuvers

At 3rd level, you learn three maneuvers that are fueled by your barrier ticks. You can use only one maneuver per attack. At 10th level, learn 2 additional biotic maneuvers and another 2 at 14th level.

Some of your maneuvers 
require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver effects. The saving throw DC is 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier.

___Disarming Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the barrier tick die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

___Distracting Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

___Feinting Attack.___ You can expend one barrier tick and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 2m of you as your target. You have advantage on your next melee attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll.

___Goading Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

___Lift Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to lift a Medium or smaller size creature or object. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is lifted.

___Menacing Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to frighten the target. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

___Pushing Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to drive the target back. You add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 8m away from you.

___Riposte.___ When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one barrier tick to make a melee attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the barrier tick to the attack's damage roll.

___Sweeping Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 2m of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes force damage equal to the number you roll on your barrier tick.

___Trip Attack.___ When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend one barrier tick to attempt to knock the target down. You add the barrier tick to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.


#### Biotic Focus

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to focus your biotic energies into your muscles granting additional 
speed and strength. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* Your speed is doubled. 
* +4 to all melee weapon damage rolls.
* You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


#### Improved Barrier

At the 10th level, increase the die type of your barrier ticks to d10. At 18th level, it increases to d12.


#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 14th level, you can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Opportunist

At 18th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature 
within 2m of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack 
against that creature.


### Shock Trooper

Shock troopers like to fight up close and personal, using charge to dash around the battlefield and ripping enemies apart with shotgun blasts.

#### Biotic Bull Rush

At 3rd level, you learn the charge cantrip. If you have already learned it, you may learn a new cantrip instead.

The distance of charge is now 20m. When you use your action to cast charge, you may use a bonus action to shove or make one
weapon attack against the target. You gain +5 to the attack’s damage roll or shove the target 6m. To shove a target this
way, it must be no more than one size larger than you.

#### Stunning Strike

Starting at 6th level, you can focus your barrier into the impact of your charge spell. When you hit a creature
with your charge cantrip, you can spend 1 barrier tick to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be <condition id="stunned"/> until the end of your next turn.


#### Shotgun Savvy

At 10th level, Brutal critical and Zero-sum can be applied to shotgun weapon attacks.



#### Onslaught

At 10th level, you've mastered your charge spell, maximizing its damage. The damage of charge becomes d10 +
your spellcasting modifier.

#### A Touch of Force

At 14th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons with your barrier. As a bonus action, you can expend
up to 3 barrier ticks to grant one weapon you're carrying a bonus to damage rolls equal to the number 
of barrier ticks spent. The additional damage is force damage and can detonate primed targets. This effect lasts
1 minute.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


#### Blitz

Starting at 18th level, whenever a creature within 20m that you can see makes a weapon attack or casts a spell, you can use your reaction to
cast charge, targeting that creature. Resolve any effects caused by charge before the creature takes its action. The creature
may choose to make a different action this turn.


### Nemesis

Nemesis vanguards prefer distance and using biotic powers. While they lack the raw power of an adept, they're more crafty and harder to take down.

#### Biotic Recovery

At 3rd level, you have learned to regain some of your biotic energy by meditating and calming your mind. Once per day when you finish
a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than a third of your vanguard level (minimum 1), and none of the slots can be 3rd level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 10th-level vanguard, you can recover up to 4 levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either
two 2nd-level spell slots, one 2nd-level and two 1st-level spell slots, or four first-level spell slots.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\page

#### Metabiotics

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use the power stored in your barrier to twist your spells to suit your needs. 
You gain two of the following Metabiotic options of your choice. You learn another one at 10th and 14th level.

Metabiotics can only be applied to spells of 1st level or higher.

___Careful Spell.___ When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 barrier tick and choose a number of those creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

___Distant Spell.___ When you cast a spell that has a range of 2m or greater, you can spend 1 barrier tick to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 barrier tick to make the range of the spell 10m.

___Empowered Spell.___ When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 barrier tick to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metabiotic option during the casting of the spell.

___Heightened Spell.___ When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 barrier ticks to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

___Quickened Spell.___ When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 barrier ticks to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

___Twinned Spell.___ When you cast a spell that doesn't have a range of self and is incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level, you can spend a number of barrier ticks equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell.



#### Biotic Attacks

At 6th level, you choose one biotic cantrip you know and one biotic spell of 1st level you know. 
You may cast either spell as an attack.

By spending 8 hours training, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.


#### Biotic Fury

Starting at 10th level, the effects of brutal critical and zero-sum can be applied to your biotic spells
that require a spell attack roll.


#### Teleporting Dodge

At 14th level, as a reaction to an effect that causes you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use 2 Barrier ticks to automatically
pass the saving throw.


#### Bombardment

Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your biotics intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the
highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage.
You can use the feature only once per turn.
